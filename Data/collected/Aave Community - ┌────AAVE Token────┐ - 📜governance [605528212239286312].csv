@joeismyname In terms of the total market cap of lend = total insured value might not be concrete as the protocol can be partially insured or even same debt capital insured by multiple times depending on the value of LEND market capitalization. What is interesting is that the incentives are like thrust engines that are adjusted based the need for securing the protocol.

@Deleted User No, but to give some insights current phase is phase 0, after this one phase 1 is coming with governance and phase 2 with full tokenomics within the protocol. We will be giving more details when we release the tokenomics and governance documentation. We also released some details on our Ethereal summit presentation, you can find more details in this article:

@rb 
LEND token will be used to govern the protocol, we are currently working on the implementation of the governance apart from this it will be possible to be staked within the protocol to provide security/insurance to the protocol/depositors and that way earn staking rewards and fees from the protocol. Also currently LEND token is burnt based on the fees gathered in the protocol, so holders benefit on the reduction of the supply. We are working to release the specific documentation about tokenomics and governance for more details. Meanwhile this article may be helpful:

@brucecost 
LEND token will be used to govern the protocol, we are currently working on the implementation of the governance apart from this it will be possible to be staked within the protocol to provide security/insurance to the protocol/depositors and that way earn staking rewards and fees from the protocol. Also currently LEND token is burnt based on the fees gathered in the protocol, so holders benefit on the reduction of the supply. We are working to release the specific documentation about tokenomics and governance for more details. Meanwhile this article may be helpful:

Couldn't the liquidation be executed atomically from the pool and redistributed to that same pool among share holders? 

This would create a powerful feedback loop reinforcing the rest of positions as colateral would go up on each liquidation instead of random 3rd party.

No, because I'm doing spread, basically I want to short impermanent loss.
To do so I need to borrow LP tokens, then unpack them and add the underlying as collateral.

Like the whole point of IL is that you loose money compared to someone who is holding the underlying assets, let's assume this is longing IL.
Well, I want to short IL, so I do the reverse (borrow LP tokens and deposit underlying), then if IL kicks in I'll win money compared to the one holding LP tokens.","","ü§î (2),üëç (1)"

I'm an Index Coop contributor and we're looking to launch a leveraged 2x MATIC token (similar to the FLI tokens on L1) that uses Aave Polygon on the backend. However, the Max LTV for MATIC is prohibitive so we'd like to request that the LTV be raised to 65%. I want to be respectful of the process and risks though so if anyone would be willing to support, we would greatly appreciate it!

I was going through this article recently https://uncommoncore.co/a-new-mental-model-for-defi-treasuries/ and had a couple of questions regarding how the Aave treasury is being managed currently and its expenditure etc? 

My main questions are:
1. As per OpenOrgs (https://openorgs.info/), Aave currently has $551 million of Aave tokens in the treasury. Where can I find the the monthly expenditure of the treasury?  (Note: In the financial reports submitted by Llama here (https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-treasury-report/5575/8), operating expenses is blank for both September & October 21 reports)
2. I know Aave company & Aave protocol are different, so is Aave protocol treasury used to fund Aave company operations or is it done separately from VC funding etc?

I'm planning to raise a discussion thread on treasury management in the Aave governance forum and so wanted to understand the basics of Aave treasury before doing that.

emergency admin power can pause the lending pool
aave guardian elected members https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-guardian-elected-members/5772

> 2.  How can emergency admins be overrulled?
governance can set the emergency admin through the gov process and the new emergency admin can unpause
> 3. Why there are no docs about this kind of info?
the docs refer to it as guardian multisig (not explicitly mentioned as emergency admin so maybe confusing) but I agree it is not very detailed. I will update the docs, so all information is easily accessible and much clear.
> 4. Is the fallback oracle mantained and live?
The address of fallback oracle can always be queried from Price Oracle available in deployed contracts section in dev docs. The price from fallback is used only if source is 0 or price is negative. So fallback oracle prices are not actively updated rather main security focus is to keep asset price source up to date.
Anyway you can find fallback oracle here üëâüèª https://etherscan.io/address/0x5b09e578cfeaa23f1b11127a658855434e4f3e09#code

They see how your address voted (visible to all) and then you collect your bribe in an airdrop like interface... You can optionally delegate your vote to votium but that is a convenience and fallback in case you forget to vote. You can vote the desired way to earn the bribe or the other way to forgo it if you feel strongly. Importantly, you as an individual are always in control of both your principal token and your vote.

No matter how badly votium goes, your cvx is never in their smart contract. Worst case is you lose earned but not collected bribe if they get hacked/exploited.

Here you stake the AAVE or stkaave in a bribe smart contract. If those are malicious or erroneous, those tokens are at risk. I see no need to organize things that way when you can delegate or vote the desired ways. So why are bribe so insistent on taking possession? They say some comment about front running that makes no sense to me. Unless their contract blocks you from withdrawing once they accept a bribe, in which case your tokens could be voting for something malicious and have no control to stop it.

Custody and additional smart contract risk should require a strong justification. With delegation and publicly visible voting, i see no good reason to do this unless they are intending to not give your tokens back until after the vote. And not bothering to clarify that in tweets or Medium. That's the most innocent explanation I could find tbh.

I'm working in an exchange and investigating AAVE for listing.
I dont know if this is the right place to post question or not so please direct me if I'm in a wrong room.

According to the crunchbase url (https//www.crunchbase.com/organization/ethlend/company_financials), 
it seems that there are 8 VCs that invested to Aave.
I need to find out the relationship between them and Aave.

https//cryptobriefing.com/aave-raises-25-million-led-blockchain-com/
Here it says the investors will participate the staking and governance.
I assume they stake and vote through same service as common hodlers, correct?

or do they interfere directly to Aave?

"704784847209758810","Mathias_L#9829","04/20/2022 5:07 PM","Hi I have a question around the power dynamic of Aave as a platform. 

A proxy contract is used to govern the platform correct? That means every update cannot be enforced upon users. Instead  a new version is deployed and then users have to get coordinated towards using it. That eliminates the threat of web2 platforms that could enforce more and more features upon to bind us to the platform and ultimately extract way more rent than we initially anticipated. So I like the decentralised approach of course.

But it brings up the question of what tools the governance contract really has to coordinate users towards a new update. For example if Aave wants to raise its fees how would that work? Couldn't users just keep using the old version?

And also what happens once a trillion is locked in the protocol, how could updates then be implemented? How do you make a trillion move to a new updated version? 

I guess the front end is a tool to coordinate but that is in control of the team rather than the token holders right?

So how does all of that work exactly? And how will it work in the future? Or am I missing something?

If it passes, it adds a function that allows for users to claim their stkAAVE rewards without passing a `to` address as a parameter; instead the rewards are passed directly to the address that calls the function (and has earned the rewards). This change allows for Enzyme vault managers to claim rewards on behalf of their vault, but has a wider application to any set of contracts that uses the same proxy architecture.

The code this proposal implements has been audited and approved. It passed a snapshot at the end of last year (https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmcgTovk982fcUTN17qtDyZ4oCoVGnKZJGuwMVtqspfphk).

IIRC the justification Aave provided on twitter for this decision was ""we didn't think there was going to be borrow demand for stETH"". I do not believe that, and even giving you the benefit of the doubt that assumption is definitely not true now - go check euler.finance for proof - the borrow APY for wstETH is ~5.5% with $32.5M worth of it borrowed (over 50% utilization rate). 

It is so obvious this is getting into systemic risk territory (not only for aave) but other protocols built on top of aave. From your governance ""Due to uncertainty around the stETH peg, Gauntlet proposes increasing stETH liquidation threshold. This will allow borrowers using stETH as collateral with more buffer in case stETH continues to depeg, and thus decrease the chances of liquidation cascades that lead to insolvency on the Aave platform"" https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/75/

What is the real explanation for not enabling borrowing on stETH. Every other large asset on your platform can be borrowed, but the largest one can't!? And there is a ton of risk around stETH - you have smart contract risk, trust assumptions, merge uncertainty (not only around if/when the merge happens, but possible forks) and you are limiting the market to weigh risk here.

I'm writing to ask for your support in adding :MAI: MAI to Aave V3 on Polygon. MAI is a stablecoin that is fully overcollateralized by 60+ collaterals, and we believe that it would be a valuable addition to the Aave V3 platform. 

MAI is already available on a number of other major chains and dexes, and we believe that adding it to Aave V3 would increase growth exposure and liquidity. We would be grateful for your support in this matter üôè 

Worth mentioning that MAI has no exposure to USDC and other centralized stablecoins.

If anyone is interested, I am writing a draft proposal (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lAHjZx8m4J-meswzTk1BypxIAZum-W-GQfurEHPn7U0/edit) for Aave that will allow the GHO-USDC LP position on Uniswap v3 to be allowed as collateral for GHO in an isolated lending market.

The ability to leverage yield farm this LP position has the potential to garner significant liquidity for GHO-USDC which helps its peg and will generate revenue for the DAO.  And the isolated lending market is an extra layer of precaution against depeg events or manipulation.

Happy to discuss further and get feedback from the community!  Much appreciated.","",""

What do people think about a partially anonymous forum? Has anyone censored their controversial ideas due to fear of social reprisals? What have you done if your idea goes against the big players in the DAO? Can partial anonymity be a way to start addressing group think?

I understand that social reputation is important in qualifying the ideas but, it also gets in the way of viewing ideas based on its merits. In certain cases, we censor our controversial comments because it goes against the grain of the majority of DAOs and we tend to not point that out because of fear of social reprisal. Again, this may get in the way of having the most effective decision as some ideas are not considered (and that ‚Äúconsensus‚Äù is a more of a capitulation than general agreement that we have the best idea.)

I believe that certain topics may require an anon space to assess the ideas by its merits rather than rely too heavily on the social representation (albeit it has an important role in the DAO).

It's a risk-related topic: How can we get standardized trade volume stats for asset onboarding + risk mgmt.

Sounds trivial , but it's not. Looking thru onboarding proposals, most use the aggregate CoinGecko number (which incl CEXes with low trust scores). Wash trading is an issue and we don't need to accept the existing, substandard approaches.

We are trying to find the best model for our delegation process, so we are researching information about governance, DAO and delegation.

1. How many active delegates do you have? How their vote power is distributed? 
2. What are the stats of Delegate involvement (i.e. voting, percentage of token supply delegated, number of proposals voted on). Do you track this?
3. Does Delegation help you to solve Governance problems? Is anyone doing something surprising with Delegates? Is something that you would like to improve or change?
4. How did DAO ‚Äòtrack‚Äô and communicate about Delegate involvement? (i.e with tooling etc)
5. What is your assessment of the interfaces/tooling that community members can use to elect Delegates (i.e. ease for token holders to delegate, ease for delegates, how much do these interfaces affect the utilization of Delegates).
6. How do you involve the community to delegate? (This is not easy to convince them).
7. How you engage with your community (not delegates or entities)? I suppose that via Governance call. Any advise, help, suggestions how can be improved the governance call and how to engage more community in it ? üôÇ

Some of the questions i already found via your forum and tools, but would be great if you could answer them anyway. Maybe i missed something or you can point me out something relevant that i missed.","",""

Here is an example template, for those that are interested: https://granting.ethelo.net/

If you want to pay less network fees select a cheaper networ like Polygon or Arbitrum.","",""

As per my understanding, AAVE currently employs the governance v2 model. I noticed that a proposal for Aave governance v3 was voted on Snapshot two weeks ago, but an AIP or on-chain voting has not taken place yet. Should I consider Aave governance v2 as the latest document for my reference? https://docs.aave.com/developers/v/2.0/protocol-governance/governance#proposal-life-cycle

Regarding to Snapshot, as as per v2 documents, Snapshot voting is optional but highly recommended for consensus. However, within Snapshot settings, there is a min quorum set at 320K as well as 3 day voting period + 1 day voting delay. Since snapshot voting is not mandatory, I'm wondering how relevant this quorum and durations? Also historically, there are several snapshot votings took more than 5 days. Was there any update in 2023 regarding to duration?

Regarding to onchain voting, Level2 requirements are updated with proposal 106 - https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/106/ - could you please confirm?

Sorry to ask many questions, but the confusion is that there are several documentations, not clear which one is the latest . so proposal 106 lowers the proposition threshold, quorum and vote differentials for long executor proposals, right?","",""

Many of the questions asked here lately are being redirected to the governance forums because that is where the conversations are happening.

Therefore it makes sense that this channel will be read only from today.

If you have any governance questions we encourage you to search and ask on the governance forums. Thanks! :superhero:
