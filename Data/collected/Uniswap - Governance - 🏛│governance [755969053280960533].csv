It doesn't make any sense to offer fee rewards+LP tokens that you can deposit to liquidity mining pools for ETH-DAI for example, and not offer it for UNI pools (only fee rewards). Not to mention the way more less riskier assets DAI,USDT to impermanent loss.

@Wizard88  I also think chances are low, it may be ""tough luck"". But the rationale is that it is likely you were trading UNI in early volatile times and it was part of your implicit  risk (tactics). That the essence of the airdrop was for Uniswap to become more decentralized and for that,  new coiners were targeted  to understand its value and those targeted newcoiners would have all clicked on UNI gift link, and interacted by the Dapp contract (buy, sell, claim) , and hence probably exempt from making this error since they would not have had any need to interact with the contract at a lower level.","",""

@Kolten Yes, I am aware of that. A proposal could be of the spirt to incentivize with a second airdrop anyone with a wallet that provided liquidity after the 1st of September and before some determined date X. Only for wallet that have withheld 
 a certain X% or their 1st airdrop coins. Unfortunately the pool rates are too low and UNI tokens are not an input, they are the output. If a newcoiner puts in 1 ETH worth into the ETH/WBTC pool (crypto pool) at the current claim-rate they would be looking at being rewarded less than 1 UNI per week as yield.

There would be a huge advantage to uniswap too if it pulled traders and LP to an L2 chain as we wouldn't even need to redistribute the .005 fee from LP's the protocol could raise fees and the cost benefit to everyone would still be positive as the overall fees paid for trade on a L2 chain would still be far less.","","👍 (2)"

This will let the community make proposals and get them floating through the community for advancement to delegates.

=-Adoption of ETH/UNI in to liquidity mining program.

=-Renewal for another month of liquidity mining programs.

=-Against Dharma airdrop proposal because I see their proxy contracts/wallet and monetization scheme as a potential danger to the sovereignty of Uniswap governance. [Open to discussing this with community though!]","","👍 (3)"

So it's up to this community to take this seriously. The token is once again one of the worse performing assets in the top 100. Every time BTC goes down, UNI dumps, BTC goes up, UNI goes sideways. There is either too much inflation and/or a lack of value capture. There is a proposal to incentivize a UNI/ETH pool, but it will not pass because the community doesn't have the votes. Dharma does, and the dev team is happily promoting this as a good thing. I'm not seeing why anybody should value governance when clearly they won't have a voice.","",""

@mmoossttaaffaa 
I think the equitable argument in terms of result misses the point of the argument on hand, at least how I see it. The announcement made a distinction between ""users"" and ""addresses"" in who gets the distribution. Then it added ""addresses that attempted to interact with the contracts but failed"". Addresses aren't necessarily one-to-one in terms of natural person to address but it's at least pretty well understood that ""users"" use and for Uniswap, using it is a process that either adds liquidity, removes liquidity, or makes a swap (in simple terms). This creates confusion when on one hand ""users are entitled to the airdrop"" and on the other hand ""addresses that interacted with the contract successfully, and also those who tried"" are explicitly included and that's the final word from the devs. Outside of Dharma there are still other users who certainly used Uniswap's services, perhaps thinking they have used it directly, perhaps not caring that they did but knowing that it was a possibility, and perhaps purposefully chosen to do so but on a platform that uses a proxy contract. Using isn't mutually exclusive. I think we need to settle that question even if just to set the outer boundaries for the future as to what constitutes as ""using"" Uniswap.","",""

Backed this up on the forum, but will do so here too. 

One of my concerns is information lag — this helps mitigate that. It’s not the case that delegation = blind trust, but the current proposal -> vote timing assumes that’s the case. 

48 hours is plenty of time to see a proposal, do analysis, and see where your delegate’s head is at. If you disagree, you can re-delegate for that proposal.","","👍 (1)"

@brendan_dharma  I speak for many people and request that you focus solely on uniswap and uni token and not use it for self agenda of your own project by attempting to piggy back uniswap protocol user base to shift on to your project, what @Hayden Adams 🦄 has done is awesome he has earned the respect from all of us, and unfortunately it seems dharma is doing their best to do the opposite, I believe we are still in early stages and you can make a turn around from this and be innovative, when you say you will not “let go” it sounds very ugly especially coming from a project founder. You need to let go of that grudge and stop treating uni token as a badge of honor token and to earn a quick buck or two and focus on adding value to uni token and uniswap protocol with exciting features, things that make people go WOW and not WTF are these guys doing. I think you guys have been a bit tunnel visioned and distracted with holding your grudge instead of moving forward and building which is how respect is earned!","",""

# MVP for Applications and UNI Governance Partnership

An application MUST provide an easy access to:

# A Link to the [Uniswap Governance](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote) page through the primary portal, or view that the end user interacts with.

Verbiage SHOULD be copied from the UNI Governance page as such in the interface for the applcation:

[Uniswap Governance](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote)

UNI tokens represent voting shares in Uniswap Governance. You can vote on each proposal yourself or delegate your votes to a third party.
[Read more about Uniswap Governance](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/)

# Exceptions

* If the application does not support browser transactions and web3, the functionality for web3 support MUST be implemented so that UNI in the user's wallet can be;

1. Self Delegated, or
2. Delegated to an Ethereum Address or ENS name.

* The application MUST provide an ability to visibly confirm which address, the user has delegated to. If the user is self delgated, this should be emphasized if the the users wallet address is not easily viewed when checking the UNI balance.

* The application MUST provide an ability to view current UNI Governance proposals, and whether they have been passed or not.

* The application MUST provide an ability to vote current UNI Governance proposals, and notify the user when the voting is ended.

* For transactions that end in the user holding UNI, an alert to Self Delegate OR Delegate to an Ethereum Address OR ENS Name MUST be raised and require a user to actively DECLINE delegation.

* Any view of the user wallet MUST show that UNI tokens are either delegated, or provide a link to begin the delegation workflow.","",""

@Chris Blec Hmm, I think there is nuance to this. 

First off, ""decentralizing"", IMO, is the movement towards less concentration of power. Moving from 1 decision maker to 2-of-3 vote would be ""decentralizing"". IMO, ""decentralizing"" does not intrinsically mean ""put power in the hands of users"". 

Secondly, the initial UNI distribution did a lot to decentralize Uniswap's governance, and UNI inflation will continue to increase decentralization.

Finally, whether you like it or not, investors and team members hold tokens right now. It's hard for me to understand the logic by which delegating their votes to Dharma is not an increase in decentralization","",""

@qklpj.eth that makes sense. I think it's better to decouple incentivizing from voting into two proposals. We get the first one out, we build momentum, we pass the first proposal, and subsequently we create a second proposal, get a developer to implement the change, audit the code, and get that second out. Binding the two is not the most efficient to go about it, IMO.","","👍 (2),gandalf_nod (1)"

Dharma is a corporation and like any other corporation they have their corporate jargon. You guys didn't allow that at all. You stripped it all to pure information. Maybe it was a little too obvious that you guys are opposing Dharma airdrop.

This is the approach they took, they never mentioned vesting and the decision is up to us and was given to us by Hayden before governance if we decide to allow them the airdrop or not and with the approach they took and how committed they are for a quick buck instead of moving forward and building is just ugly, Brendan and Nadav could have totally just dropped this attempt and changed their attitudes which for the past 3 days everything we say has gone through one ear and out of the other.

@ayomide agreed, nothing wrong with the proposal itself. But the optics were wrong, it looked to many like a takeover the governance with Gauntlet. In facts, Dharma has introduced their users to uniswap, and we can only hope they keep building and enable their users to participate in the governance.","","👍 (2),💯 (1)"

However, it's extremely minor, and he's *also* illustrating what he believes to be threat vectors. A permanent ban from the Discord seems heavy-handed (was he also banned from the governance forum?). He seemed to be a dev and someday he might be a good solidity/ethereum developer. There's been an increasing defense afforded to Dharma. You ""obviously"" banned him for being useless and annoying, nothing more. When Noah said he was ""actively"" spreading disinformation, he was likely implying he was *intentionally* and *actively* doing so. My main point is just that a permaban seems too heavy-handed, it's not good for the whole. I don't know if you had other reasons for the ban.

All they're doing is farming UNI, dumping immediately to cause nonstop-built in sell pressure, and then pumping up the price of their external farm project token to dump and rugpull on the newbs. 

By enabling a new UNI pool and allowing LP's to vote where large uni whales are already involved with the external farm projects to potentially farm a larger percentage of the UNI rewards, it could potentially make the price dumping even more severe and it would allow them to vote in favor of more dumping to favor short term gains over the long term goals of UNI. They could 5x short uni and long their token and multiply their bags in short order.

I propose a 2 month time lock on the uni rewards and an additional incentive for each month the reward claim is delayed (for example, each month after they get an additional 10% bonus on their entire rewards)

This will stop the farms in their tracks as it'll  be hard to convince anyone that a farm wont rug pull after 2 months or they'll create vesting tokens that might be worthless if the team rugpulls as well.

@ifunoinsideuyield that's an interesting point. Besides DraculaProtocol, do you know other platforms using this ""drainable"" protocol? The reason I am asking is the TVL on Dracula is really small, doesn't seem to have caught on. if that's the only platform with this automated draining protocol, it's currently insignificant, and not worth halting incentivizing the UNI/ETH pool. However if you can point to other platforms doing the same, and we can estimate the aggregate TVL to be a significant percentage, then I would agree we need some mitigation ASAP.

@brendan_dharma thanks for providing this feedback. I agree with the costs. For the first one, there's already talks of enabling LP to votes, so hopefully it can be addressed in a subsequent proposal. For the second, I agree but I would say it's an needed incentive to prevent farmers from selling and short sellers from continuously dumping on holders. I think Augusx1211 also said something similar, that the incentive felt artificial. I get that, but IMO that's the best fix we got that doesn't require new code, audit, etc, etc. Again, a more long term sink would be better indeed.","","👍 (1)"

@brendan_dharma cuz most of the community is made out of hodlers, and I think the reason most people hodl $UNI is the belief that the token (should) capture some of the value of the platform. So it's painful to see the platform grow but the token depreciate continuously.","","👍 (2)"

@brendan_dharma True, I agree, and that's why it feels artificial to many. But it will curb the short selling and the farmers dumping (which is based an articificial incentive of $UNI). Now I am not saying two wrongs make a right, but I understand the pool incentives are meant to grow the network, the number of $UNI holders so that further decentralize the Uniswap governance. So I get why the Uniswap team did that, but unfortunately, without an incentive to hodl, farmers dump (and short sellers have a field day).

@Po That makes sense. But I don't know a successful token without a value capture. So, this makes sense in theory, but in practice, good tokens give hodlers a reason to hodl.

@Po I disagree. 6 months in crypto is a long time. From now until then, we have plenty of data telling us what will happen to the $UNI token. I know some people thought the sharp depreciation was market related, but I think by now there is a consensus that it is due to the current token model. I understand your point, but the market is also making a point. If the market was making that point every now and then, that'd be one thing, but it has made that point consistently every week.

@Po there is a difference between price action and token model. A token is designed to align the interest of the actors that make up a community. Self-interest/greed is not a bad thing, when it is aligned with the self-interests of the other actors that make up a community or network. You want to say it's okay for investors to subsidize farmers and other actors. But so far in crypto, the largest set of actors in any projects are hodlers. It's one thing if the price action is down for market reason, but this is not the case. The token model is punishing holders and rewarding farmers that dump on hodlers. Do you not see the difference?","",""

@DaoChemist the token model disproportionately rewards farmers during the first two months of UNI existence.
The token model also disproportionately rewards past users compared to present and future users. And compared to buyers too.

@Po You're dancing around the topic. ""Disproportionately rewards"" doesn't reflect what is actually happening. Hodlers are subsiziding farmers. That's what happening. They are also asked to subsidize airdrops on top of that. You see no problem maybe because you are farming?","",""

@VSP Wrong! There's a diminishing return for having TOO much liquidity. As you can see - liquidity is increasing and trading volume is decreasing. Most of the attracted liquidity is just leeching UNI rewards. Stop the incentives, leechers will leave, trading volume won't take a hit - I'm 100% sure.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755969053280960533/771751223350788096/gg.jpg","👍 (2)"

1) Presently you can delegate 100% of your balance to 1 address. 
2) A delegate cannot further delegate a portion of their votes to a new delegate. 

I want to create a proposal to update delegation with the ideas below:

1) Delegate less than 100% of your votes to an address
2) Delegate votes to more than 1 address
3) A delegate can further delegate their shares to someone else.

@Deleted User It is a serious question. I think if you look in the history of economic and political systems, positive incentives (self-interest) have better outcome than negative incentives (punishment). The next set of proposals IMO should incentive more users to become $UNI holders to further decentralize the governance, so that the vote is a true reflection of the opinion of the $UNI community.","","🍻 (1)"

I sincerely hope that UNI governance does not vote for a buyback&burn model when the 0.05% fee is implemented. I think you shouldn't even have an opinion on the topic unless you've read and internalised the above blog post. 

I think simply ""stablecoins as dividends"" works really well in the long run, and I think Curve chose the right path regarding this. This way people get the cash flow from owning CRV (by locking to veCRV), but they freely choose what to do with that cash flow, whether the compound it back to more veCRV, or to do something else.

Buyback&burn first forces you to accept that more UNI is bought with the 0.05% cash flow, and then it would be simply burnt. It can hurt the long-term capitalisation and growth of Uniswap as proposed in the blog post, if done this way. 

I'm surprised that the tentative consensus in the Uniswap community seems to be towards a buyback&burn model. It would be a mistake in my opinion.

> @Micah A few points, I don't think the discussion surround the fee switch should be dictated by which of the two paths are taxable events and which aren't, but instead which incentivizes holding onto UNI and better rewards active participants.  Following the second line, I would argue that a Synthetix style staking mechanism that distributes trading fees is way better at encouraging holding UNI than a burn mechanism. Using BNB as an example there was a ton of analysis done a year ago about how the Burn was a tradable event, people buying before and selling. We can argue the nuances about how BNB doesn't buy on the open market leading to a buyer of last resort, but that still doesn't change my point of it not incentivizing holding the token.  Overall both options would make UNI a better token than it currently is, but I would waaaaaay rather see UNI being a productive CF producing asset for token holders than just a deflationary asset.","","👍 (2)"

@Tritium agree with your sentiment here. It's great that we're all so passionate about Uniswap but we need to accept that thousands of people having an equally valid voice and opinion is going to create enormous gridlock.

I imagine over time people will begin to just establish their own mental model of a ""board of directors"". Voices will begin to quiet and the more dedicated and trusted members come forward.

@OatMan Don't know exactly what @allô meant but if I may: it could be accomplished by something akin to YFI where there is a treasury of sorts; the protocol overtime builds a reserve or pool of liquidity it controls so UNI holders control and utilize that reserve

2)  there can also be a staking (and locking) mechanism to the liquidly pool tokens so they stay in the protocol for X amount of time","",""

@Po Honestly this whole debate could have been avoided by implementing a vesting program similar to SNX to prevent UNI holders from immediately dumping their coins, but instead the coins are subject to a timelock, or even better, a smart contract trigger that kicks in when total exchange volume reaches a certain level.

It would be very interesting to receive news as a Uniswap user - what is the team focusing on these days, what's the progress, what was done in last few weeks/months/update news etc - any information is better than solemn quiet. 

Is there any community manager or a person who is in touch with the team and can provide news updates, dev diaries, short interviews, that sort of thing?

Right now, when Uniswap Governance are being established, it would be nice to know of project isn't stalling, but rather progressing, developing and going the way it's been directed to go to.","","👍 (1)"

@Highdra There are three main roles in an AMM ecosystem: liquidity providers, traders, arbitragers. LPs take the risks of impermanent loss and gain the fees. I know what you actually mean is that Uniswap can let the LPs make enough money without liquidity mining. Maybe you are right.

Uniswap 3 will be able to run independantly from governance
Governance still controls treasury, still has the same mandate to help uniswap grow.
Tbh it's a good thing Uniswap will continue to run independantly from governance b/c right now governance does almost nothing. the only proposals we had were for a shady retroactive airdrop ( I say this, and I would have received 800 from the first phase of this airdrop if it had been voted). the dev team really **can't** count on governance. the big delegates are just sitting there, doing basically sweet nuthin'. or at least, it's starting to look like it very much.
Also, the purpose of UNI is to get access to fees eventually. But it's only going to be worth it if Uni grows a lot more IMO. Incentives campaigns can help a protocol grow, as you know.

Uniswap has the potential to steal a lot (more) marketshare from CEXes, so I'm pretty sure there are some forces at work behind the scenes. There is a chance that it could explain why governance (= very much controlled by big delegates) has been so stale/uninteresting for now. (Except the nice discussions we have on the governance forum of course). So, to wrap this up, it's a very good thing that Uniswap 3 continues to runs independantly from governance, because it could stay in a deadlock for a long time. That being said, with more active big delegates, governance could also be an asset to the protocol, instead of a deadweight.

PS another reason why big delegates seem to be asleep at the wheel right now could also be that V3 is imminent and they have been told to wait for the release/announcement. Just another guess. We can't really know.","",""

When people send funds directly to Uniswap contract by mistake, it's their own fault, I know that, but it would be a great service if the funds could be returned for a small fee.

Uniswap can't know who is the original sender, it can only assumes that the sender of the claiming TX might be the original sender (lack of better solution)

> Since the tx contains the origin address, destination address and amount delivered I don't see how anyone could alter/change or divert funds
Because for uniswap to access this it would require to read a previous TX which is completely forbidden by ETH's model (allowing lighter clients to delete old state of the blockchain and only remember the current state and the 1000 or so blocks (prunning))

> Using historical tx to assert that some ERC20 were received in contract but no subsequent outgoing tokens, it should be logically possible
Yes but ETH doesn't allow to read historical data (from the EVM, obviously us can do whatever we please with our nodes, looking into the past, but EVM cannot).","","😎 (1)"

"183309006767521792","jorropo","03/03/2021 11:31 PM","@research_omega BTW for sake of completeness if somehow you would implement this there would be 2 ways to implement this (the good and the bad one).

You could use the ERC20Receiver interface on uniswap (having a function called when an ERC20 transfer has occur) that would assert failure.
And having all ERC20 tokens support Receiver (checking does the destination implements ERC20Receiver and if so call onERC20Received). (like http://erc721.org/ does).

And an other solution would be for all ERC20 to store all the TX somewhat (saving the history in state) and allowing uniswap to read it, then uniswap would be able to see who sent him some coins. (would be very complicated an expensive and thus **bad**).

The main problem is that way too many ERC20 tokens doesn't support ERC20Receiver (which is one of the thing 721 fixes).
The problem of starting to use ERC20Receiver today is that there is very little insentives to do so:
- This is somewhat complex to implement
- Very few receivers contract exists and would take advantage of it.
- Very few tokens support forwarding so writting an ERC20Receiver would be almost useless (as almost no tokens support it).

But I still think there is value in starting to use it. We are in an egg chiken problem and starting to use it, as an optional feature (as lack of better option) might drive his usage up in the future.","",""

Noteable for gov is the last paragraph:

> Direct routing will be tricky long term but there are two ways this could happen.

> 1. The latency/infra cost of pinging MM's with an order outweighs the price benefit of routing outside of Uniswap. This will only happen if Uniswap is hyper liquid and block times are <<15s (e.g. on a rollup). Additionally, most aggregator routing schemes involve marginally increased UX and gas costs (although this is mostly an approval related cost which will subside as the approval flow is deprecated with account abstraction)

> 2. Incentivize direct routing with $UNI. **Uniswap governance is sitting on ~$5 billion of UNI that could be used to incentivize direct flow, rewarding both takers and routing interfaces.** Not sustainable as t → ∞ but worth it if it allows #1 to come to fruition.","","🦄 (3)"

However it's important to realise that the feeSwitch isn't continuous, it only happen when someone remove liquidity from the pool.
So if someone added liquidity, make profits while the feeSwitch is enabled, and then fee switch is disabled and finally the user remove liquidity, all of his profits would ignore the fee switch.

To avoid such strategy from LPs it's best to never turn it off again (or at least tell them you are doing so). However changing the fee switch from a strategy to an other is totally possible and have no negative impact.","",""

The first is the structure
-Some of the changes that I would think is needed is to decrease the threshold to create a proposal, this will not be on the main page but on a secondary/tertiary page  
-Reduce the threshold own to a much smaller dollar worth of UNI or a percent of market cap, then allow to reach a formal platform when it reaches lets say 100-1000x worth of UNI and then maybe 2-3x on top of that to the worth of UNI to be successful proposal. This would be pretty similar to the way COMP does it. 
So there will be three layers: one with most proposals... those that gain traction and hit the secondary threshold will go on a highlight page where those can see the main proposals...afterwards the third threshold is needed to officialize the proposal

The problem with UNI's governance is that not only does it make it *very*difficult to pass proposals (which honestly isn't to bad of a problem, should probably be reduced a little further) but more importantly, the ability to even ***propose*** an idea is tunneled down to only so many individuals. This makes the ability to propose **centralized**. This is counterintuitive to the point of decentralized governance. Thus, having these extra layers will allow for more conversation and decentralized method of gov. 

However, the parameters for the above thresholds should also vary with time
- the price of UNI

Really looking forward to improving governance participation! I think we're taking the necessary steps in the right direction by means of (potentially) decreasing threshold parameters. This would be a major move that could serve long-lasting ripple effects throughout the Uniswap community. 

As a result of this proposal passing, I'm thinking two scenarios will play out both of which will result in the increase of proposals: 

1. More self-appointed delegates will emerge - ultimately leveling the playing field to some extent. I would not be surprised if this inspires the creation of cohort-like delegations. 

2. Closely intertwined with the #1, current delegates may experience an exodus, if you will, of voting power. This may benefit the community at large and insight more innovative, challenging, and community-driven ideas in the process. 

Granted, there will be some spam proposals in the process (majority of which I'm anticipating will go no further than a mere off-chain temp. check).","",""

- Support for V2 pools.
  This would be really usefull for the tiny tokens that havn't moved to V3, currently V3 is really good at trading stuff like ETH, stable coins, ... but if you want to sell your mTSLA into USDT, the whole path will be V2, while actually it's likely that only the mTSLA is better on V2, all the rest of the path is better on V3.

- ~~Support for the DAI PSM (||<https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/module-psm/>||) module. This is a contract that allows to swap a token into DAI at a fixed rate without fee (or really really tiny), concretelly there is one for USDC, that mean 1 USDC = 1 DAI and 1 DAI = 1 USDC.~~
  ~~This would help consolidate stable coins together, currently if you have some USDC and the price on the DAI pool is better by 0.03%, it's still better for you to use the USDC pool as you have a 0.05% fee going from USDC into DAI, this allows 0% fee from USDC into DAI and the same in the other dirrection.~~

In v2, you set a fee switch receiver, this fee switch receiver have the LP tokens according to this ratio : (valueAtExit - valueAt) * 1/6 (first calculate profit made so excluding what has been brought first by the LP then take 1/6 of that) when the LP remove the liquidity.
So when someone remove liquidity, the receiver receives LP tokens worth 1/6 of the profit made by the LP.
**So on v2, when someone remove USDC / UNI liquidity, the receiver contract receive USDC / UNI LP tokens.**

So I guess when the reward pool is big enough an auction slot would be held were bots could lock some UNI tokens for the LP tokens, and the one locking the most UNI win the LP tokens (and pay the UNI).

So example :
`obscureTokenA` and `ETH` are both for sale. A first bot propose 150 UNI for this, this start a 1 minute auction, an other bot propose 160 UNI as he is capable to route on balancer and thus knows a better price.

After weeks of asking and asking around, I concluded that the only feasible way is through using thegraph protocol via GraphQL queries.

I have now realized that in order to perform even a single query on TheGraph, I am required to pay in GRT.

This has perplexed and confused me in multiple levels...

1. Am I going about this the right way? Is there an on-chain way to perform my task that I am missing? ( I have asked over 5 times in the #💻│dev-chat channel without receiving any response....)

2. If the only way to query uniV3 is through TheGraph... how does Uniswap DAO justify its data being only queryable through a paid / gated service? This sounds to be quite against the ""open-source"", ""blockchain open data"" philosophy...

3. How are other DAOs actively supporting this new, gated, single point of failure that TheGraph is?

4. I know and understand there are costs involved in maintaining this infrastructure, everyone knew this when TheGraph started and positioned itself as the ""single-source-of-truth"" for many queries... Is this now a matter of TheGraph leveraging their unique position in expense of the developers? Why aren't DAOs taking the brunt of the costs ~~and instead participate in the fees collected?~~ How does this make sense in an industry that so severely lacks application development?","",""

TheGraph protocol is charging from the first query, effectively raising a paywall on their new system. That is hampering developer adoption and does it in quite a self-serving way as the unit of payment for the service is the GRT token. I know Uniswap has invested significant resources and given grants for its subgraph to be created, much like other DeFi protocols have done. For a more in-depth analysis of the case, have a look at this thread: https://forum.thegraph.com/t/why-is-there-billing-from-the-first-query/2233/","",""

1. When I go to the Uniswap governance portal at https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote, I only see 7 proposals. Does this mean there have only been 7 proposals that made it to an official vote in the history of Uniswap? If not, how can I see the full list of proposals that made it to an official vote? 

(I've also looked at the proposals at https://gov.uniswap.org/ and https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap but my understanding is that these do not represent binding votes. I read this first: https://gov.uniswap.org/t/community-governance-process/7732)

2. Does the list at https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote represent binding proposal votes for both v3 and v2, or does it represent binding proposals for v2 only? If v3 proposals are separate, is there somewhere I can find a list of binding proposals that have been put to a vote for v3? 

3. Was a successful governance vote required in order to deploy Uniswap on Optimism? 
- If so, can anyone share a link to the proposal and vote results to help me better understand the process?
- If not - and the Uniswap team can deploy to L2s or other chains without a governance vote having to take place - would there be no point for community members to start an official vote to deploy Uniswap on other L2s/chains like Arbitrum/Polygon? 

Even if deployments to other chains are not bound by governance, it seems like the community could still get the attention of the Uniswap team to suggest these things via Temperature and Consensus Checks. Please let me know if I'm on the right track here.","",""
"730463593711140956","BOR4#8524","08/30/2021 7:03 PM","@defideer 

1. Yep 7 went to the vote
2. Governance doesn't make a difference between v1 v2 or v3. In your proposal you submit what actions you want to do and if it passes those are automatically executed.
3. It didn't need a proposal because Temp Check had such a huge vote in favor team decided to do it themselves.

These are brief answers but I hope they help you","","Uni (1)"

# That only #🦄│speculation on my part, don't take me liable for this:

But I think if you do that, people are realise that the exchange volume is big ok.
But UNI's market cap is enormous and doesn't line up with the reality of the current volume.

In other words.
Not making money allows UNI to be in a ""startup"" phase. You must not make money right now, because else people will want to know how much and realise that you suck.
What you do is that this startup phase you are a precious gem, and you are able to keep a high price, not with current revenues, but with a promise of even bigger future ones.
If UNI's price is that big right now, it's not because it has great benefits (the governance sits doing nothing most of the time and most of the rest of the time it's boring stuff, almost no one owns UNI because of only the governance), but because it promise way bigger benefits in the future (with a fee switch when uniswap does the trade volume of NYC Stock exchange for example).

If we enable fee switch right now it's possible that the market will start to see UNI not as a great future anymore but as a present that is pretty lame (0.4% APR is bad, and so would see the price crashing to a level where the APR is mostly alligned with the rest of the market).","",""

🧡💛💚💙 Hi Uniswap Fam. I have made a Uni Gov post + Medium Article to propose a DHSM (Diamond Hands Staking Model). 

It is the best tokenomics in the game. I believe UNI can benefit from using it if we use it to distribute UNI rewards.

We can distribute them via Mining rewards in the next proposal or from the LP rewards if we turn the Protocol Fee switch on


Please have a read and comment I am welcome to all. 

The current issue is that many big DeFi whales, UNI holders included, keep voting NO to do any mining programs. They are protecting their bag because they do not want to grow. 

We need to use this DHSM (Diamond Hands Staking Model) to reward long-term UNI believers.

**The reason why the big whales hate the mining programs is because they just give out rewards to vulture dumpers. But with my model, you can distribute the rewards to people who commit to locking up UNI long-term. They get more rewards than those short-term. **

And people who exit early, pay an emergency stake and the rewards go to the believers (50% Treasury, 50% Believers)

Thanks for all commentary I am just trying to make us move forward in an optimal way... All information is in my post + medium article :uniswap:","",""

For the recipient address in the Treasury Vester contracts (four of them), the current recipient is set to Timelock address. Timelock address has Governance address as its admin. The current recipient address of the Vester contract can change the recipient via `setRecipient` function. And since Timelock is the current recipient, and it's controlled by Governance, it means that Governance can change the recipient to a new address.

When you say ""malicious proposal"", it becomes more philosophical. For example, assuming the contracts have not been exploitable, and someone proposes that the recipient be changed to, say, the burn address, and the current holders of UNIs actually vote for that proposal, then yeah sure the vested UNIs will then start getting burned.

2. I know Uniswap Labs & Uniswap protocol are different, so is Uniswap protocol treasury used to fund Uniswap labs operations or is done separately from VC funding etc?

There is a team called Silo that is building something similar to Uniswap with a twist.
The improvement they bring is shared base tokens (i.e. in WBTC/ETH and MKR/ETH - ETH is the base token).
Otherwise it is much the same as Uniswap, but the shared base allows for higher capital efficiency.

If it works - is this something that Uniswap could copy to the Uni platform?

does anyone have more information on how governance works on layer 2?
As far as I know, there is only a governance system on L1 -> Governance calls need to take a bridge to L2.

I did some research:
For **Polygon**, they use **Fx-Portal:** Seems to be used to relay governance calls from mainnet to the UniswapV3 contracts on Polygon:
-> See Fx-Portal Contracts: https://polygonscan.com/address/0x8a1b966ac46f42275860f905dbc75efbfdc12374#readContract
-> `l1Owner` is set to the Uniswap `Timelock` (Ethereum mainnet) contract (i.e., L1 governance system).
-> The `UniswapV3Factory` contract on Polygon has set its `owner` to this `Fx-Portal EthereumProxy` contract.
So it looks like you can bridge governance calls from Ethereum Mainnet to Polygon via this `Fx-Portal `contracts, which will be recognized as `owner` by the UniswapV3 contracts on Polygon.

However, I am not sure how it will work for **Arbitrum** and **Optimism**:
UniswapV3Factory contract on Arbitrum: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984#readContract
-> `Owner` is set to the same address as the Ethereum Mainnet (L1) `Timelock` contract
However, all owner-checks in `UniswapV3Factory` are still written in the form `require(msg.sender == owner);`
But the Arbitrum documentation mentions that this will not work? (Quote: ""`msg.sender` — will not simply be the address of the contract on L1 that initiated the message; rather it will be the contract's ""L2 Alias."", https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages#address-aliasing)

Does Uniswap's implementation with `require(msg.sender == owner);` work on Arbitrum and Optimism? I.e., is there a bridge so that the L1 Timelock contract can create a transaction that, after being passed from L1=>L2, is recognized as coming from the L1 owner address (Ethereum Mainnet Timelock contract)?

Would be great if someone here could share some insights. The process and architecture do not seem to be documented at the moment.","","💯 (1)"

In the UNI token launch blogpost, Uniswap Labs stated that the allocations for team members, future employees, investors, and advisors are subject to a 4-year vesting schedule (https://uniswap.org/blog/uni). But as far as I know this is not enforced through smart contracts, and the tokens appear to be fully liquid. I think the only vesting schedule transparently implemented on-chain is the one for the community treasury.

I am not entirely sure what you mean by ""community allocations."" But from a technical perspective: UNI tokens of the ""community treasury"" are not delegated right now. You can look up the UNI token contract on Etherscan to see that there is no delegate set for the Timelock contract address (owner of the community-treasury allocated UNI Tokens).

We're launching our ethereum co-chain this May and offering major incentives for tier-1 Defi projects like Uniswap to deploy on the Kava platform.

We're essentially giving away 200M Kava ($800M+ USD) for protocols who can  bring TVL onto the Kava platform. We've already launched our testnet, and giving an additional 100K Kava for projects who deploy early on testnet before May.  

We'd love for Uniswap to deploy on Kava and not only earn a bulk of the rewards, but build a strong and enduring partnership.

My understanding is that when a proposal passes the temperature check and consensus check, the proposal, in the form of codes, get implemented into the protocol's smart contracts. So governance is decentralized. However, when I checked the GitHub repository of uniswap V3 for instance, I see that there are only 11 contributors who are team members of Uniswap Labs and they are fixing buys and adding features to the protocol constantly. My understanding is that as Uniswap team members they do not need permission from the community to implement changes to the code. What I am trying to understand is, if the team members are able to independently change parts of the code for the protocol, couldn't there (theoretically) be changes or implementations that are not necessarily aligned with what the community wants? What are the things that team members are ""permissioned"" to do without consent of the community and what are some things that they cannot do unless it gets voted on? Thanks!","",""
"617127949480493077","yj_alt","05/24/2022 4:27 PM","Governance has three steps. Temperature Check and Consensus Check are off-chain Snapshot votes. Then there needs to be a formal on-chain proposal, encoded with the smart contract operations to be run. If that passes, the transaction can be executed.
https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/concepts/governance/process

The ""Protocol"" is mainly the smart contracts that have already been deployed, with admin rights handed over to the governance contract, which is in turn controlled by UNI token holders/voters via the process above. V3 has already been deployed, and cannot be changed directly by the Uniswap Labs team anymore. Any change that they can directly make is only for the UI (on app.uniswap.org) and any associated periphery functionalities (e.g. Auto Router in the swap router). Note that the UI and router(s) are just one of many that can be used to access the on-chain Uniswap core smart contracts. It is not compulsory to use the Labs UI and/or routers, e.g. you can see DEX aggregators using their own UI and routers to access the core Uniswap Protocol smart contract functionalities.

> My understanding is that as Uniswap team members they do not need permission from the community to implement changes to the code

Depends what you mean by the above. Uniswap Labs are the authors of the BUSL-licensed code for v3-core. They can build upon the code and redeploy if they want to, but they are not able to change/overwrite the existing v3-core smart contracts that have already been deployed onto the currently known addresses, as those are controlled by governance (see above). For example, without governance vote they can decide to deploy a new Uniswap-v3b to a new set of addresses, but IMO it's unlikely that liquidity+users will follow and migrate over, unless there is overwhelmingly good reason/incentive to support their new v3b.","",""
"881015177502412851",".ys34","05/25/2022 1:31 AM","Thanks for the explanation @yj! So Uniswap Labs team can directly implement changes to the periphery functionalities but not the core code itself, and the UI that we usually access is the one where these functionalities are incorporated. But users can choose not to use these peripheral functions and utilize the smart contract however they want. And when the team decides to deploy something new, lets say a v4, users can always choose to use the older version or even fork the smart contract. If I were to try and compare the ""administrative power"" of Uniswap Lab's team to another protocol say Aave, how do you think I should go about doing it? Would you say teams of different projects have different levels of admin power over the protocol or would you say its more less the same where there is a core smart contract that the team can't touch but a set of peripheral contracts that the team can freely work on? If I want to look into the details of this would you be able to point me to relevant parts of the smart contract or GitHub repository? Thanks a lot!!","",""

This is our rough map for Grants v2
would love to know your opinion on few concerns i have
1) In this model there is a Review Team Like the one in UGP, Lets say this commitee rejects a proposal that the community loves there could be an issue(eg. funding asked could be higher than expected) and at that point do we conduct a poll of sorts and add it to the forum or is the commitee's decison final.
2)lets say we keep it decentralized and let it go straight to community voting on forum,what is stopping a degen from asking 200k and the community voting in favour.

"471357824299958273","crypto_rachel","07/28/2022 1:28 PM","So the last community call got me thinking about the fee switch and ways to overcome all the obsticles there are in creating this outside of a contract 

The idea of testing this out with V3 having full control over which pools have this fee switch and how much

my proposal is that we create a Staking contract in conjunction of the fee switch contract receiver, and also adding on a ERC20 Wrapped UNI where this wrapped Uni is used in a ETH/WUNI pool, allowing this to be unwrapped as well via contract.

This would allow UNI holders to stake the uni and provide that wrapped UNI to the pool to limit loss from the fees lost in the LP, Also having a UNI/WUNI pool would allow routing through this pool with regular UNI token routes

Now the main reason we can bring in UNI LP providers is that in this contract we would want to retain UNI Holder Voting rights, the Vote would need to be done via this contract and have a ipfs site to vote on, but by tracking and setting the users ability to send vote via the contracts holding of their UNI, this would allow them to still Vote, although a different delegate system would also have to be set up

But by reducing the loss in LP fees and allowing UNI holders to keep their voting power, I do believe this would be enough incentive for LP providers of UNI token at least

Obviously this would be a very complicated contract, but I do believe that this would offer a good incentive to open a Fee Switch Testing pool","","🧠 (1)"

The forum wasn't letting me post so thought I'd survey interest here. Trying to see if anyone would want to collaborate on this proposal.

**Proposal**

This post is gauging interest and collaborators in formally proposing that 1% of Uniswap transaction fees go towards RedemptionDAO.

**What is RedemptionDAO?**

27 Million Hectares of protected rainforest are up for auction in the Congo. This is a larger plot of land than all of the National Parks in the USA combined. The bidders are oil companies looking to exploit the land for resources. A grassroots team of over 200 Web3 environmentalists formed RedemptionDAO (redemptionDAO on twitter) to try to raise the funds to win the auction, allowing the continued protection of the land by helping the community earn carbon credits for the avoided deforestation of the peatlands and trees in this area. Donors have already pledged $74,000 but this isn’t enough. Uniswap has the opportunity to show the world that web3 can make positive change in the world. 

**Impact**

Uniswap has the chance to make an impact on the climate crisis, raise awareness about the DAO, and change the public perception of crypto. Additionally, climate crypto is based on Celo (which Uniswap is the recommended DEX for use by the Celo community). Driving liquidity towards climate action would likely increase transaction volume on Uniswap.","",""

If the UNI community and governance have appetite to still pursue a uni-v3 moonbeam deployment, the governance process will need to be done again, I would say.","","ALPHAFUNDAVA (1)"

I am contacting you to provide our expertise in governance when it comes to the subject of DAOs. 
We are a team of academic researchers, blockchain developers, lawyers, financiers and political scientists who have been working for over 10 years to develop a scientific paradigm for collective decision making, at the intersection of social choice theory, welfare economics, decentralized artificial intelligence, collective intelligence and strategic marketing. 

We have introduced decision rules that offer expressiveness and usability, robustness in the way they analyze information, limited manipulability and scalability. 

The rules are tailor-made: governors can strategically orient the collective decision between performance, equity and consensuality.
We have solved the Condorcet Paradox: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_paradox 
which is a 200 year old problem on governance. 

I know that there are many pain points in DAOs and the governance of blockchains protocols nowadays and there are still many challenges to overcome regarding:
- Consensus Mechanism
- Tokenization Mechanism
- Voting Mechanism
- Smart Contract Mechanism.

By working with us you will get assured to get the best recommendations/product which fit your market needs.
Do not hesitate to contact me back if this is of interests to you.

Kind Regards.


Vincent

Holdim has already received a grant from Uniswap Grants, and as we head into our second Milestone, we want to invite you to participate in the Beta testing of the app. 

Beta testing features include the ability to follow the projects you like or have governance tokens for; in the feed, you will see their governance proposals in the voting stage on Snapshot; all the governance proposals are shown in tl;dr form made by AI. 

We invite you to participate in the small survey and actual testing of our app. In this form (https://forms.gle/B5mHd8P5kCVeK1e89), you can apply to participate and we will have some rewards for you. Thank you for helping us!","","🔥 (2),Uni (1)"

What do people think about a partially anonymous forum? Has anyone censored their controversial ideas due to fear of social reprisals? What have you done if your idea goes against the big players in the DAO? Can partial anonymity be a way to start addressing group think?

I understand that social reputation is important in qualifying the ideas but, it also gets in the way of viewing ideas based on its merits. In certain cases, we censor our controversial comments because it goes against the grain of the majority of DAOs and we tend to not point that out because of fear of social reprisal. Again, this may get in the way of having the most effective decision as some ideas are not considered (and that “consensus” is a more of a capitulation than general agreement that we have the best idea.)

I believe that certain topics may require an anon space to assess the ideas by its merits rather than rely too heavily on the social representation (albeit it has an important role in the DAO).

Governance is in control of the Uniswap Protocol core smart contracts. Frontend (main one being app.uniswap.org) is open-sourced, and maintained by Uniswap Labs, but not under governance control. If you want to ""accommodate LPs and swappers the ability to swap information"" at the smart contract level, someone will need to create a whole new AMM for that, nothing UNI governance can do there. And if you are thinking more on the frontend level, see paragraph above.

Overall, I know what you are asking, it's just not a productive/useful thing to ask from Uniswap governance and here, is all. Also, US-based **anything** probably will end up needing to talk to their lawyers/accountants for advice anyways, that's just the situation in the US in general.

In support of furthering the vision of Multichain Uniswap, proposing that the Uniswap community vote to authorize the deployment of Uniswap bridge. We hope this proposal will serve as an example to create a generalizable, trust-minimized approach to cross-chain deployments, with the goal of supporting a multichain Uniswap ecosystem.

As implied in the name, bridges allow one to easily migrate tokens from one chain to another. 

For example converting from Ethereum to Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Celo you will need to have some ETH in your Ethereum wallet to cover gas fees when converting. Similarly user should be able to migrate from the different chains supported by Uniswap

For this we would be creating separate tab in the home page of Uniswap.

Example use case
To switch between Ethereum and Arbitrum:
Click on the ""Bridge"" tab, and select ""Arbitrum Bridge"":

This will take you to the Arbitrum Token Bridge, where you can connect your wallet and ""deposit/withdraw"" tokens to and from the Arbitrum network.

Conclusion

I am Sato (Stephan), CPO at **Almanak**. We're a crypto tech firm building a **permissionless platform for on/off-chain simulation and optimization of protocols**. 

🚀 We've started **building a sandbox to support Uniswap Fee Switch test **with benchmarking and new metrics, not currently covered within the experimentation plan.

🎯 See some details dropped in gov here: https://gov.uniswap.org/t/fee-switch-pilot-update-vote/19514/26

📊 For instance --  The current KPI (“trade execution not diminished”) may not fully grasp important levers of the fee switch mechanism. A larger set of metrics, covering trade volume, net liquidity & market share, would allow for a more exhaustive assessment. 
==> for that we can use or put at disposal our sandbox to run simulations and build new metrics, as well as benchmark yours

Would be great to engage and get feedback! 🫡

We want to share with you an analysis on Uniswap Stickiness that we did at Almanak.
**TL;DR**: 
- And because of the occurrence of triangular inter-pool trading within Uniswap pools, measuring and understanding stickiness is challenging.

- Even though we could still imply it from the other pools (used for triangular spillovers) change in activity post-switch vs historical levels, it’s difficult to disentangle what share of that activity would be resulting from which pool among the three activated pools.

- Stickiness (of trading and liquidity) is very pool-specific.

- From our analysis ETH-DAI 0.05% and ETH-USDC 1% would not be too impacted by this side effect. The former a bit more than the latter due to whale behaviour.

- However ETH-USDT 0.3% seems more prone, with #jit playing a role on liquidity and #curve on trading volume.

Overall outcome is clearly agent-driven so the experimentation will benefit from incorporating behavioural analysis through simulation.

Here is the thesis for those who don't want to open the link:
**Thesis:**

This proposal seeks to deploy a 1bp fee tier for UniswapV3 on Arbitrum. This will allow users to trade with lower fees, making it more accessible and competitive with other decentralized exchanges.

Since the launch on mainnet, there seems to be enough data to prove the effectiveness of a 1bp fee tier in increasing swap volume for Uniswap.

Currently, the Uniswap 1bp fee tier is live on the mainnet, Optimism and Polygon. Based on data and the impact it’ll have on the trading volumes, there’s no reason for it not to exist for Arbitrum.

I feel like BSC has been a pretty segregated chain, for good or bad, from much of the Ethereum ecosystem (unlike, for example, Polygon).  That said, it is pretty weird that Uniswap is on Celo (#20 in TVL).  I'm willing to bet that a lot of the votes for that came from a16z which is invested in both Uniswap and Celo.  Clearly one can't go with TVL only, or Tron would be next (uugh, definitely don't hope not, they are also on that datafinnovation blog, and not in a positive light), but you'd imagine that Avalanche would be next after Polygon...  Not Celo.  All the true layer-2s make sense like Optimism and Arbitrum, so all the zk-rollups make a lot of sense, or even Arbitrum Nova.  But BSC...  I don't know.

Regarding deploying Uniswap on different chains and L2 solutions. I agree, some of the deployments are happening on chains that traded off decentralization for scaling/speed and fees. It seems like Uniswap governance doesn't think that those are deal breakers and is willing to deploy on these solutions as well.

With that said, making Uniswap available on these solutions doesn't affect in any way Uniswap on Ethereum L1 or rollup scaling solutions. It is not that we are shutting down Ethereum deployment and are completely switching to BSC. We are just giving people option to choose. And, in my opinion, when you look at it that way there is no reason for Uniswap not to be present on those chains as well. Furthermore, some of these solutions might adopt POS and go decentralized in the future and then we might regret not having first mover advantage.

Data backs that also. We have Celo deployment but people don't think it is best place for them. That is why adoption on it is lacking. We just gave people option to choose, nobody is making people switch from solutions they feel comfortable interacting with to go to these new solutions.

Regarding whales swinging votes in Uniswap governance. Yes, whales have big influence in Uniswap governance but over time their influence should became less and less dominant. As more people get into UNI token less and less voting power will be in hands of whales and in the future we might see less whale domination in voting.","",""

I realized that, but you should reach out to cointelegraph for a correction: https://cointelegraph.com/news/uniswap-holders-ditch-ethereum-for-bnb-pos-chain-to-deploy-v3-protocol .  I was most surprised that someone at cointelegraph even /thought/ that Uniswap was ""ditching"" Ethereum, or that such an error got past their editorial staff.  Someone should reach out for a retraction/correction.  ""As more people get into UNI token""--but there's a fundamental logic block to that...  Right now, 8 UNI holders can sway a vote.  8.  Why would any regular person think they can compete with that?  In, say, most IRL political voting, it's one vote per person.  If you knew your vote was worth one millionth of, say, the top 8 richest people in the land, it would be pretty discouraging.  Now, if UNI was profit-sharing like some others out there that, you know, recently surpassed Uniswap in trading volume (something that would be unheard of until recently), maybe you'd get more people out there interested in UNI, but right now?  If anything I see /less/ interest in UNI as time goes on, and more in other decentralized exchanges that give profit sharing and other unique features like leverage.  Of course, that's tricky, Uniswap has already had to censor its front end for regulators/authorities, start doing leverage or profit sharing... yeah...  But, put in quadratic voting or something like that, and I doubt regulators would care.  In fact I suspect it would /help/ Uniswap in the eyes of regulators.  Because if power is in the hands of 8 individuals it looks more like ""expectation of profit based on the efforts of others,"" while more power to more people means more any expectations would be in the efforts of one's self--and that's not even looking at anti-trust/monopoly concerns.","",""

Compromise a little power or else lose it all.  It may be needed for self-preservation.  Now then, what is the real danger of Uniswap being on a chain that can be completely manipulated?  Let's say the most alarming interpretation of that datafinnovation article is true, that Binance Beacon chain can basically be rewritten at will, and thus can rewrite BSC at will.  Let's just simplify it and say CZ has a magic button that can do anything he wants to any transaction that happens at BSC and CZ actually wants to use it.  Yeah, what is the worst case?  I don't know.   He takes all the liquidity on their and puts it in his own account?  I mean all the governance voting still happens on Ethereum I assume (Binance, of course, is one of the biggest holders of UNI--but I don't think the use it to vote--yet [unlikely ever]).  I mean, that should be an amendment too, you should not be allowed to vote on anything you have a really strong financial incentive, like Andreessen Horowitz should not have been allowed to vote for Celo, and anything Binance/CZ/etc has should not be allowed to vote for BSC.  I am curious about the doomsday scenarios, and no one's talking about them.  Maybe because there are none.

As a thought experiment...  What would have happened to Uniswap if it was on Solana?  And, you know, it is kind of applicable that Serum had a secret backdoor with FTX that ultimately lead developers to fork.  Isn't that kind of what exists with Beacon Chain?  A secret backdoor?

Yeah, I am.  And if Binance--which seems too big to fail (but that's not stopped others before)--DOES start crumbling... or more likely death spiraling if that happened... well, I definitely think we can look at FTX for some guidance on that, and how someone was able to steal some $600 million in tokens in the confusion.  Right now, UNI is bridged to BSC, but after Wormhole (assuming it's the bridge of choice--and let's hope Jump has some more in the seat cushions if there's another issue--though I bet contagion has hit them more than they've ever let on), would that mean LOTS more UNI is bridged?

Once there's a way to vote on a Dapp, there's likely not going to be any airdrops to reward engagement.  Because the way to vote on the Dapp is very likely because of the one and only airdrop the Dapp will ever have: namely an airdrop of a governance token.  There's been moments of bandying about of another Uniswap drop, and I doubt that will ever happen (see previous point about power consolidation and desire for status quo by those in power).   So, your vote is unlikely to matter, and you're unlikely to get an airdrop.  Now, what kind of risk is there?  Look at Ooki (originally known as BZeroX or bZx).  Something very few people have mentioned (but myself, in fact I don't know of anyone else mentioning it / aware of it), is that the CFTC went after anyone who voted on an Ooki proposals, ostensibly as a way to ""go after"" the DAO and discourage devs who think they can ""hide behind"" a DAO.  But that's ridiculous a) because they didn't just go after votes that are specifically related to the actions Ooki was (is?) taking that they dislike (leverage without KYC and presumably even then only for accredited individuals) and b) you'd have to be ridiculously wealthy in Ooki/BZRX tokens to even be able to propose--like $100k in either to be able to propose.  They should have only gone after at least those who voted and fit b, and very possibly both a and b (if anyone at all, because that assumes a handful of devs can afford or should afford to maintain the necessary programs for compliance for regulation that isn't even defined AND the underlying regulation may just be gatekeeping for rich people who are just assumed to be better investors)... but I'm digressing.

In many ways, it's a similar thing.  You don't have to know how to detect sybillism.   You just have to make the punishment a big enough deterrent that it's not worth it to attempt.  Slashing wouldn't work on everyone, but I think it absolutely work on someone like a16z.  Their reputation is too important to them to risk it by manipulating governance on any one vote or any one dapp.  I think it would work--it wouldn't be reinventing the wheel, it would be using a wheel that's working really well already on PoS, but putting it on a different type of vehicle.  Eventually, solutions will come around to detect sybillism--account reputation, using AI to see patterns between connections of accounts and voting history (thankfully both on chain, making it easier), a process for accusing voters and voters having a process for defending themselves--but in the meantime slashing could be turned on immediately with quadratic voting and that should alone contain the threat.  Again, specifically with regards to a16z, which is not some anonymous, shadowy group, but an entity that would very much not want to be caught in the court of public opinion having been slashed for sybillism.","",""

Wormhole and Solana are both big investments, and a massive mint exploit cost them dearly in bailout, but likely worse if they hadn't bailed out Wormhole.  Jump Crypto is probably even more invested in Wormhole now, and probably a lot of BSC.  So Jump Crypto did the sensible thing to investigate, if Beacon is a fork of Cosmos, compare the custom code to the Cosmos code.  And found out it could cause the same issue: a massive mint exploit.

In 2020 we released the first stablecoin that earns a yield while sitting in your wallet, the Origin Dollar (OUSD). The yield is generated by tapping into multiple protocols such as Aave, Compound, Morpho, and Curve. As of February 3rd, Origin governance ratified a proposal to have a Uniswap V3 strategy for yield: https://snapshot.org/#/ousdgov.eth/proposal/0xe76cf1d102c4c119e2cef6584731cc228c9793c44187b5dcfab1a75fd038f55f 
The TLDR from this ratification is that Origin will soon be depositing millions of dollars into Uniswap, indefinitely. 

The problem however, is that the two tokens we need to utilize this strategy, OUSD and OGV, are both currently blocked with a warning sign on the platform (see screenshot). We have reached out to support@uniswap.org, opened multiple support tickets, and reached out to @Anthony 🦄 // Community Manager, to remove this warning but are still seeing it on the Uniswap V3 dex. At this point a governance proposal to the Uniswap DAO may be the only feasible way to remove this warning. 

Have there been any proposals to remove the warning sign in the past? Or is there a template somewhere for proposals of this nature? We’re not just minting assets that might generate trading fees, we’re going to be depositing millions of dollars here.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755969053280960533/1077656609746059364/IMG_0339.jpg",""

A project that i am a participant of claims that these are common in major protocols, but said project uses upgradability to change oracle values and token balances of users. Uniswap is pretty against Paused right?","",""

I have a proposal to carry out a crowd audit competition for UniswapX on Hats protocol, who can i talk to regarding a potential partnership?

Very briefly, our crowd audit competition product is based on payment for results but not for the efforts (as in the case of traditional auditing). Accordingly, if your auditors did a good job and no vulnerabilities are found in the contest, there will not be any sort of payment (including fees as well). Or if only low vulnerability issues are found, Uniswap will only pay the amount allocated for low severity, etc.","",""
