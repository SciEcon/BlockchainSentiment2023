@Magnus i know, but the reason why is because liquidity providing is super risky for anything that's crypto because of very rapid price movements. Curve is the low risk LP choice because uniswap/balancer are very high risk for LPs

however with traditional (but crypto-wrapped) FX, there is already a stable market. no crazy price movements in minutes, the markets are relatively calm compared to crypto. so its a higher-risk-than-stablecoin but still much-lower-risk-than-crypto-LP middle ground",,,

@Ronchiporc I'm not sure there is much to worry about. There is a chance that YFI holders may end up with a significant portion of governance over the CRV platform but that's not necessarily a bad thing. YFI holders are some of the bigger brains in the space, and if they want the CRV platform to flourish they will need to do whats right for the platform and all participants. I have seen on several occasions the YFI holders forgo short term gains for the longterm benefit of the yearn ecosystem. If the CRV platform becomes a part of that ecosystem it will benefit from those same decisions. My recommendation is to go buy some YFI and be a part of the governance process there.",,,

like i see the point from both sides so its hard to say for me.   but for example the shift of susd, y, comp is an easy shift because its the same asset class basically.  when curve has usd/usd. btc/btc, eth,eth, euro/euro, gold/gold  it still seems like theyll get pushed out .
So if someone can throw in 1% of voting rights to say give the gold pool a boost,  the initial returns will be good since no one is in the pool but the max liquidity still hits a limiting factor up to 1%.

but then you could say well all those new people in the pool could vote to expand it etc.   and maybe that works out?  this is why im still in on the fence just cause I cant discern that it will because old voting power doesnt go away and should always be able to keep 99% of votes in their favor.",,,

Currently it seems the boost gauges incentivizes users to put more liquidity in the biggest pools. Should we consider to reverse it and incentivize putting liquidity in the smallest pools? (Basically, taking the inverse of the weighting equation... so smallest pools have the biggest allocation of rewards and biggest pools have the smallest allocation of rewards per dollar staked...)

Not only do smaller pools have the smaller rewards (due to the gauge voting allocation), but they also have the most ""expensive"" boost. You'd have to lock up a lot more CRV to unlock a 2.5x boost in a small pool. This is a double disincentive to provide liquidity to smaller pools.",,,

@Doomlordxxx 
think this just delays the release point of the tokens. so say newly minted coins from farming get a 1 month lock, that just moves the inflation rate forward 1 month.  so in 1 month you're right back to where you were.

handing over the token isnt a bad thing.  its a reward and should be used as such. ""harming the ecosystem"" sounds like a scared of farmers selling sort of thing.  if they dont want to hold they should be able to sell.  if you want more people to hold, all we need to do is give value to the coin.
basically you have two choices:  sell crv and reinvest the profits so that you can farm more faster,  hold on to crv because you think it will be good later.
both are fair points and neither is bad.
as soon as tokens are used to say, receive fees from the system, the value of a crv token will instantly be realized and the ecosystem will come to a full cycle.   right now holding is just speculative.

@C2tP

Coins are from curve and they define the value it may hold based on the decisions, isn't that what dao is for and isn't that an inherent part of being a governance token? 

I wouldn't call it a gimmick though.. 
I call it a neccesary insurance. 

Just like how dao wasn't enabled since day 1 or even to start with founder and team reprensatives /parties who are mostly interested since its inception will for sure behind the scene have major voting rights, just to prevent misuse of DAO *precautionary measure to not allow misuse *

It's that sort of thing, any business you start you offer somethings to capture market but as other members alresdy said curve has had its liquidity and been here since long. 

And so is, according me safeguarding the interest more important than only serving as a value outflow. 

Like I already mentioned how a daos governance shifts gradually from owners founders to lp's 

The value creation mechanism also needs to shift from higher degrees of efforts in early days to avoid misuse of any feature or supply dominance and gradually fall into what's being called as normal by you *

Outright normal existence might cost a greater non repairable damage, yet again if you look at the toke as a mere reward and nothing more. Maybe you're right. 
I look at it as a token for the protocol. Behind the values. 
And so I say its necessary to safeguard it. I'm not talking about avoiding price dump at all. 

My only point here is the token is a reward and again it is source of governance, and to make sure hyperinflation or farmer dumping mechanisms don't damage its inherent right /value.",,"ğŸ‘ (1),ğŸ‘Œ (1)",

@traderex

Agreed.
But what I'm talking here is about keeping rewarding lp's
Its not about the letting one take benefit of early mover standalone and sabotage the value of what the lp's and future carries :)
Irrespective of what price crv is traded at, it carrying value is essential to keep the rewards attractive (as long as it isn't a dump only token)
Boosts will take up hardly 5M in supply AFAIK for now if locked 4 years, while daily hyperinflation ranges at half the price (DAILY)

And I strongly beleive one of the easiest ways in creating value apart from fees is simply making locking crv mandatory and or keep it optional with delayed lockup release  on yield withdrawal /

4.81E+17,pourteaux,2020/8/30 ä¸Šåˆ11:53,2020/8/30,"There are a few considerations, but I think the veCRV distributions make the most sense. The downside with veCRV distributions is that these are probably taxable events depending on your jurisdiction. The upside is that it encourages locking CRV to veCRV, and thus indirectly boosts the price of CRV by limiting supply. So, even if boosting the price of CRV is your primary goal, veCRV distributions will help. veCRV distributions are also good because they incentivize locking of CRV even beyond the minimum that will get you to a 2.5x boost. Furthermore, as your veCRV decreases with time, your boost doesnâ€™t change (unless you trigger a checkpoint). So absent veCRV rewards, there isnâ€™t much incentive now to extend the lock of your veCRV or to lock more CRV as veCRV beyond what will get you to 2.5x boost. With distributions, this changes.

Simply buying and burning CRV will more directly support the price of CRV and avoid taxable events. However if you take a longer term perspective, what is best for Curve.Fi is having tokens locked and people participating in the governance. Currently, people are selling their CRV beyond what is needed to get the 2.5x boost, or using that extra CRV to farm on cream.finance, etc. It would be much better for Curve.fi for this to be locked as veCRV. Whichever option is selected will have a big effect on user behavior, so we should select the option that will incentivize the most good behavior. In this case, that is distributions to veCRV holders.",,Curve (3),

@Kendrick Llama ğŸ¦™ I have no issue with the gauge weight voting. I just think the 10-day rule does not work with the weekly re-weighting. I don't see how allowing people to switch their votes every week wouldn't accomplish the same thing. As currently constructed, I have to wait an extra week for any vote switch to kick in.",,,

Changing your vote can happen any time, but voting for the same pool requires a 10-day wait period. This is to prevent accruing veCRV from effecting the weight of a set of pools from what i understand. Pools must wait to have the veCRV earned from them to re-reweighted towards it. Which makes sense.
If you want to switch from say ren to sbtc, you can change your vote no problem with whatever veCRV you have. But once you do, you must wait 10-days to re-weight your vote.",,,

Seems like there would be less friction in implementing the admin fee in addition to the 0.04% LP fees, under the assumption that users of Curve (especially automated ones such as yETH Vault) are much less price sensitive than LPs.

Think there may be constraints already in place for existing pools (i.e. the admin fees can only be half of LP fee). If so, something to consider for future pools",,,

Interesting idea.  It would bring to defi what huobi offered with HUSD previously in that you could convert 1:1 hard pegged USD coins.  Huobi also didn't include USDT as USDT price frequently deviates from the $1 peg.  Similar issue with DAI and SUSD.  There is good liquidity in DAI, USDT, and SUSD but I'd be willing to do more size in a pool that didn't include these as they drift more from $1 and have a higher tail risk of going +/- 10% from the peg.",,,

Right now the only stablecoin pool without exposure to it is the compound pool (which btw I would love to see a comp collecting v2). And well, with the 3pool based metapools idea, this includes most future pools. Also by locking CRV you cant avoid being mostly exposed to it.

I feel this is a trend in all the major protocols. Just recently it was enabled as collateral on MakerDao, it is one the incentivized pools in Uniswap, and it only takes a governance vote to have it enabled as collateral in Compound or Aave.

Taking Maker as an example, from a risk assesment of USDT:  

""Due to USDTâ€™s noted history of opaqueness and fractional reserve, we recommend an initial LR of 150%. This is the only parameter that can protect Maker in the instance where these risks materialize again.""
https://forum.makerdao.com/t/usdt-pax-collateral-onboarding-risk-evaluation/3723/3

There are ways to mitigate a risk of USDT peg such as taking a permanent short position, but I feel that with time this is getting harder and harder, now even my DAI come with a small USDT exposure. Will it be enabled in lending protocols as collateral if time goes by without any incidents happening, but without improving their transparency?

After all, USDT has the highest liquidity, which can lead to higher fees. But I believe this quick rise of defi and open governance allows us to set the standard of what to expect from new and existing protocols, and we should be aiming higher.",,,

I hope not ğŸ˜… , but I agree that synthethix assets like DAI could carry greater risks.

I think it is more fair to compare it to other ""custodial"" stablecoins. I cannot make the claim that USDT is scam, but I do feel like the lack of transparency is offputting, and would rather support other assets. For example I really like how Sogur (a small SDR pegged coin) provides daily proof of their reserves. I feel that if the market would demand more transparency, this could be the norm. After all they all serve the same use case. 

I am not aware of the risks of other stablecoins (except maybe DAI and sUSD), would like to hear what you think.",,,

Possibly using the Ampleforth Geyser model to incentivize longer term commitment using a multiplier that increases over time to a set max. I really like the idea of gaining the 2.5x bonus and trading fee APY with veCRV but I also dislike the dropping CRV value. The veCRV program is great from my pov however it is something that appeals to a small % of folks given the complexity and commitment. Perhaps some of the fees can be directed toward an easier to understand and lower commitment program with lower but acceptably sized rewards to get additional CRV off the market and also increase liquidity?",,,

@C2tP comparing it to a ""work token"" where the token is used to generate value to the system. for example SNX token is used as collateral in their system. If i can be honest, the CRV token is just a ""rent extraction"" because it is sucking away fees meant for liquidity providers. Put it another way, CRV tokens caused some of the fees meant for LPs to be taken away. 

To create a more valuable CRV system, we need to find better uses of the CRV tokens which will add value to the Curve system instead of extracting value/fees away from the Curve system.

@C2tP  I have to push back on this. Suppose an LP is getting 30% APY (CRV) at current $0.40 price. If you cut the distribution by half, the APY drops to 15%. But what if because you cut the distribution by 50%, the selling pressure reduces significantly and price doubles to $0.80? The APY is back to 30% again. Because the distribution is in CRV tokens and not fiat, the APY depends on the price on CRV tokens. Therefore there could be a positive feedback loop. It is hard to gauge the effect of this though, which is why I suspect that a number of whales/people did not vote ğŸ˜…",,,
1.53E+17,c2tp,2020/10/20 ä¸Šåˆ7:06,2020/10/20,"- sell pressure doesnt reduce because its just going to  someone else
- you take an immediate *guaranteed* loss for a long shot *maybe* return back to normal
- there is no positive feedback loop

a positive feedback loop would be like giving crv to traders so they get near free swaps, this increases volume on curve because it beats everyone else,  increase volume on curve means more revenue, more revenue means a better crv price because revenue shares. better crv price means LPs keep their APY.  it completes a nice loop.

in your example what happens?
you shift crv to vecrv holders,  they mostly sell just the same as LPs because theyre taking profit on their 4 year locked tokens,  price doesnt change much,  LPs get less and remove liquidity.
i just dont see it making the platform of curve stronger. 

like lets say crv price jumps 100% tomorrow.  what happens? does that make the platform stronger?   more LPs will come back because APY is better now.  more people will sell though instead of locking too.   having lots of liquidity is great though dont get me wrong.  but the focus should be increasing revenue. and that could be expanding the swap services or even creating something new etc.   this, in turn, will create value for the crv token.   revenue is literally the only thing that gives crv value",,,

@C2tP if a company has 120m shares outstanding and announce that it will be issuing 2m/day new shares to outsiders. within 1 year, existing stakeholders would see their ownership drop from 100% to 14%.

Assuming that the 2m/day cannot be changed, one way to reduce dilution is to issue some of it to existing stakeholders (eg 50% or 1m/day to existing stakeholders). within 1 year, existing stakeholders would see their ownership drop from 100% to 57%.

fell a sleep so sorry to bring this up again but...

we'll probably endlessly disagree as i see:
1. any minted crv as normal inflation no matter who's hands it goes to.
2. also that its an immediate guaranteed hit to LPs with a hope for a possible price recovery = risky move.
3. risky mechanic since people with vecrv can just continue to increase allocations to pump their bags with crv to cover apy droppage while LPs continue to be the only ones to take the hit. (like businesses laying off staff during a down turn but board members still get bonuses)
4. price may dip but focus of further development should be on increasing curve revenue, thus things like this are a distraction from what's important.

now that being said, this is obviously just how i feel and opinions differ. However, if the votes go in favor of cip23 i suggest the following be added to the proposal.

- gauge claims directly to vecrv and NOT crv (using Voting contract's deposit_for() function)
- a max weight can not be assigned in the gauge controller, so the gauge itself could have a max weight settings and anything assigned over that gets redistributed or burned.  setting this max weight would require real proper votes and not weekly gauge weight shenanigans. this could at least mitigate damage from imbalanced gauge weights giving too much to the vecrv pool.


feel like if this middle ground was implemented then at least some of my concerns can be mitigated, but obviously im still a ""no"" as i think it will only hurt curve",,,

@Cryptonic that's true. As long as you don't deposit/withdraw/claim on the gauge it is static for the most part.

Assuming you only locked just enough for the original LP? Assuming the pool is the same size (ish) then yes. If the pool shrinks or grows it could change how much veCRV is required for you LP boost (in a positive or negative way).

Yes, but businesses buy back and especially issue shares only very rarely (even TSLA does that two times a year maximum) while CRV issues new CRV at an insane rate every day. It's not really comparable. Companies don't dillute by 50% each year, but maybe 1-3% if they really need to.

The amount of fees generated, assuming you take half from the 0.02% which are intended for veCRV holders, is so small that this won't even make a dent in sell pressure compared to the newly issued CRV.

What I see the effect of the CRV buybacks: temporarily buys with funds which were taken away from veCRV holders, which would otherwise have got them. And then they're held in the fund. So veCRV holders can watch the CRV which were supposed to be for them get less valuable in the fund. If veCRV holders wanted to do this, they already can.

1. The ""2017""-style staking, which is simply non-dilutive in PoS /DPoS style systems, where by participating you are ""earning"" staking rewards, which actually just offset inflation. No additional value in created here, and it is simply a way to maintain consensus in L1.

2. The ""2020""-style CRV staking where you lock tokens to *earn actual fees/cashflows/dividends/earnings from fundamentally valuable activity by offering external users a valuable service in exchange for these fees*

Using words like ""fees/cashflows/dividends/earnings"" when referring to 1. is a huge smoke and mirrors strategy that even today some of the L1 projects are using to confuse people and make them invest in their shitcoins.

To me it is clear that 2. is the market potential that many are dismissing as ""another APY promise"", but in fact this is the golden goose. This is the untapped holy grail in crypto, real cash flows & dividends that make companies fundamentally valuable.

UNI & other blue chip DeFi projects will join Curve to activate admin fees, and at some point the market will probably understand all this. Until then, I'm accumulating & locking long-term with this strategy.",,"ğŸ’¯ (3),ğŸ‘ (2)",

yveCRV advantages:
- can be freely traded
- earns more from admin fees than veCRV because it also gets 10% of the yield from the yearn vaults it boosts

yveCRV disadvantages:
- cannot be used to gain personal boost

yveCRV risks:
- voting power concentration
- the locking up idea is no longer necessary if yveCRV can be freely traded: if yveCRV existed when i started using curve, I'd not have locked up my personal CRV then

If we ignore the interactions between LP and veCRV lock for boost for the moment (would make it even more complex)

    (2)    Buy and lock CRVs for fees
On Yearn:
    (3)    LP in automated vaults ïƒ?can dominate (1)

veCRV must be at a discount to yveCRV, because yield is lower, but also because it includes the risk of a 4 year lock.
However, veCRV enables you to get CRVs back after lock (negligible for now in my opinion, as 4 years is an eternity)
Large discrepancies between CRV prices and yveCRV price could be arbitraged away depending on the yield differences and (subjective) risk of lock.

@nagaking 
It is more profitable right now, *if* you ignore the following:
- gas costs of claiming & selling your CRV
- gas costs of re-distributing to different LPs
- costs of having to lock up veCRV (basically, you can assume a value of 0 for those) while in in yveCRV you can get back their current time value at any point in time
- convenience of not having to babysit your position

Motivation: one day, it is likely to see regulations that will attempt to make minting USD tokens illegal if they are not baked by real USD and in a way that can be audited. This may not happen very soon although It may happen one day. The main reason could be that the US gov will want to control the minting of dollas as opposed to allow minting via collateral at Synthetix, MakerDAO, etc.

It also seems that the official digital doller will be minted by the Fed potentially. This would further increase the probability of regulation of tokenized dollars on blockchains.

(fees for the trader are a minimum of 0.05% which is more than Curve) & (seems like being a curve LP is still better with all the CRV rewards, and more volume because of low fees?) it also might be scarier as a trader doing a $60mm swap on uniswap because at the moment it's not clear to me how obvious it will be to see where LP's have their price bands set, and i wonder if there could be some crazy slippage scenario where you execute near the same time or just after a huge LP withdraws, i guess there can be max slippage guardrails in place

the other interesting side of this is how Curve is getting more into cross asset swaps through synthetix(is the overall fee for that less than 0.30%?), so while uni is crawling into curve's space, curve is also crawling into uni's.",,,

(1) uni v3 will implement/emphasize â€œmax slippageâ€?for the reason you mentioned if targeting large-vol stablecoin swap market (it seems to me very easy to implement ... if something is easy but necessary, ppl will do it for sure, isnâ€™t it)
(2) curve is unique due to its amm curve, which is the part uni does not have, this will lead to large slippage for large-vol swap ... but v3 seems trying to do the same or something similar, even more advanced - they claim it can increase capital efficiency to harvest much more tx fees",,,

7.38E+17,ne1k0,2021/6/5 ä¸‹åˆ10:49,2021/6/5,Boost will only decrease when/if you claim or stake/unstake from the gauge. Otherwise no it does not decay as veCRV does continuously.,,,
7.38E+17,ne1k0,2021/6/5 ä¸‹åˆ10:49,2021/6/5,RE: 2nd question. Indeed.,,,
4.38E+17,Jaqen#8180,2021/6/5 ä¸‹åˆ10:52,2021/6/5,"Thanks, you mean claim the reward , and stake/unstake LP ? or more veCRV",,,
7.38E+17,ne1k0,2021/6/5 ä¸‹åˆ10:54,2021/6/5,"I mean your _boost_ is calculated everytime you interact with the gauge itself; whether it be to claim the CRV earned, or to deposit/withdraw LP from it. Doing so will recalc your boost with _current_ veCRV; otherwise it would continue to be whatever was calculated last time you interacted with it.",,,
7.38E+17,ne1k0,2021/6/5 ä¸‹åˆ10:55,2021/6/5,"Adding more CRV to your lock will not cause this to be recalculated. Should your boost go _up_ / _or_ down due to the current state of the pool or your own lock, it needs some interaction to take place.",,,
4.38E+17,Jaqen#8180,2021/6/5 ä¸‹åˆ10:57,2021/6/5,"got it, so the boost calculated by the ratio between i locked compared with total locked correct ? 

And every time i interact with gauge,  it will be re-calculated . 

So my locked veCRV will be decreased linearly over the time?",,,
4.38E+17,Jaqen#8180,2021/6/5 ä¸‹åˆ10:59,2021/6/5,"the reason i ask is pickle is doing similar , just want to make sure crv and pickle are doing the same or there is slightly difference",,,
7.38E+17,ne1k0,2021/6/5 ä¸‹åˆ10:59,2021/6/5,"Yes to the ""decrease linearly over time"" and ""every time I interact"".

Kinda for the ""ratio between locked and total locked"". It's also effected by your pool ownership ratio.",,,
7.38E+17,ne1k0,2021/6/5 ä¸‹åˆ11:00,2021/6/5,If the pool were to increase in size even with your decay and dilution as more people locked total crv; it could still be a larger boost if the pool size increased.,,,
4.38E+17,Jaqen#8180,2021/6/5 ä¸‹åˆ11:03,2021/6/5,"got it, another question is about weekly fee , the reward will also be decreased since my veCRV is decaying?",,,

7.38E+17,ne1k0,2021/6/5 ä¸‹åˆ11:05,2021/6/5,"no, that's calculated using your veCRV total at the moment someone calls the snapshot/distribute call every week. This value is used for the incoming week to determine your share of all fees.",,,
4.38E+17,Jaqen#8180,2021/6/5 ä¸‹åˆ11:06,2021/6/5,"i see, so the reward sharing will decay on weekly basis",,,
7.38E+17,ne1k0,2021/6/5 ä¸‹åˆ11:06,2021/6/5,Assuming others are locking > $CRV every week proportionally to you. You are not the only one experiencing decay.,,,

if more people locking, proportions will be decreae, as my share is decreaed ?",,,
4.38E+17,Jaqen#8180,2021/6/5 ä¸‹åˆ11:09,2021/6/5,so it is all about shares of the total locked CRV.,,,
7.38E+17,ne1k0,2021/6/5 ä¸‹åˆ11:09,2021/6/5,Yes; _or_ if they extend the expiry period on their existing lock.,,,
7.38E+17,ne1k0,2021/6/5 ä¸‹åˆ11:09,2021/6/5,You can do that every week as well and maintain ~4years with no real decay,,,

On the DAO minter or lock page. You can pick a new expire date.",,,
4.38E+17,Jaqen#8180,2021/6/5 ä¸‹åˆ11:12,2021/6/5,"oh, you mean without lock more CRV, as long as i keep hit 4 years lock time every week, i could get no decay ? but just extend the period forever",,,
7.38E+17,ne1k0,2021/6/5 ä¸‹åˆ11:13,2021/6/5,"Exactly, you'd never be able to sell/transfer the CRV used under the lock, but your veCRV power would remain the same absolute number.",,,

7.38E+17,ne1k0,2021/6/5 ä¸‹åˆ11:14,2021/6/5,Do what?,,,
4.38E+17,Jaqen#8180,2021/6/5 ä¸‹åˆ11:14,2021/6/5,keep renewing expired data,,,
7.38E+17,ne1k0,2021/6/5 ä¸‹åˆ11:14,2021/6/5,"Oh, I'm sure they do constantly; it's in their best interest since they've already committed to it being locked in perpetuity.",,,
7.38E+17,ne1k0,2021/6/5 ä¸‹åˆ11:15,2021/6/5,At least weekly just before the snapshot for the next weeks fees.,,,

Would there be any appetite for Curve to launch on Celo? Looking into acquiring CRV tokens for governance voting depending on what the overall sentiment/appetite is.

EVM compatible, growing user base (1m+ addresses), and curve would be the ideal platform for growing universe of programmatic stablecoins (cEUR most recently launched) and synthetic variations of those stablecoins.

7.04E+17,STAGHA#4583,2021/7/7 ä¸Šåˆ9:23,2021/7/7,"I did some research on the FRAX pool. My conclusion is this: Basically, the entire supply of FRAX is controlled by a few stakeholders. 96-98% of the FRAX supply is in pools, with the FRAX3CRV pool being the largest with 62%. Almost the entire FRAX3CRV pool is controlled by the AMO curve, which in turn is controlled by FXS holders. A look at the initial distribution of the FXS shows that 35% belongs to investors and the team. 60% should be distributed to the community through various programs, but the recipients of these programs are the initial stakeholders. Now comes the important part: The Curve AMO creates new FRAXs and pools them in the FRAX3CRV pool, stakes the LP tokens and collects the CRV yield. What happens to the CRV returns? The CRV are sold in the open market to buy FXS and then burn them. The idea is to generate the CRV returns through an artificial pool and to give FRAX investors the opportunity to slowly sell their FXS. Why is FRAX remaining stable? Because the supply is controlled exclusively by a few stakeholders and AMOs and these are controlled by FXS holders. Therefore, no bank run can happen: Because nobody owns FRAX worth mentioning except the FXS holders themselves. In my opinion it is a dirty game and serves to save investors from a completely lost investment by using an artificial curve pool to generate CRV returns in order to slowly buy out investors. If this is true, it is also a failure of the CRV community, which awards the FRAX Pool comparatively high CRV incentives.",,,

It is not capital that decides there. Their system just mints FRAX without tokens as security and pools them in the FRAX3CRV pool. As I explained, the FXS of the initial investors are bought with the CRV yields. It is effectively a closed system with the purpose of generating curve returns. I don't think it's a good look to bailout investors like Galaxy Digital. It's better to distribute to real LPs. I am only trying to enlighten one or the other CRV holder.",,ğŸ‘ (2),

Someone has proposed a d3pool in June (no direct expo to centralized coins like USDT or USDC) and there was a favorable snapshot vote, but this seems to have died on the vine for reasons I don't understand (I think you can search by d3pool). I would love to see that one go live with a gauge, but I wonder how much trading there would be.

If you want to be censorship resistant, you can't really rely on any centralized coin - Tether is not going to even wait for a court order if a US prosecutor asks them to freeze an address, and the onshore stablecoin providers want to effectively become the endorsed ones in lieu of a CBDC so they will probably not push back hard either.",,ğŸ‘ (2),

I have a few questions regarding Curve governance.

1) Once an on-chain vote has been created, is there a review phase before it being active? If yes, how long is it?
2) How long is an on-chain vote active? How many days?
3) Once succeeded/defeated, is there a timelock for execution/expiration? If yes, how long is it?
4) Does veCRV have to be delegated to yourself? Are there delegators?",,,

I am currently planning a qualitative study of DAOs/Blockchain project governance mechanisms and the tools and techniques they use to build communities around their values and issues of governance.  âœŒï¸",,,

More than happy to make a proposal and put that through governance as well.
 
Instead of harvesting their rewards manually, they would be able to stake their LP, earn the rewarding token/s($CRV & $MATIC), and then sell off their earned $MATIC if its a duel rewards farm for more $CRV. Then they can have their combined rewarding token earnings of $CRV($CRV+$MATIC sold for more $CRV) staked into a single staking auto-compounding pool to earn more of that rewarding token($CRV). As an automated option, there has always been just vaults to earn more of the underlying LP. This would be earning more of the rewarding token exclusively instead of the underlying LP in an automated fashion. This would also put buy pressure on your native token $CRV. Lastly, it would also alleviate some sell pressure that Beefy puts on your token from vaulting and selling off you rewarding token for more of the underlying LP. Both of these combined will not only give users another automated option for investing, but will also potentially help the $CRV chart.

What This Means For Your Community:

-An automated farming option you can offer to your users to earn more $CRV instead of more of the underlying LP
-Buy pressure on $CRV = $CRV price rising
-Less sell pressure on $CRV because the users that prefer to earn $CRV instead of the underlying LP will now have that automated option to choose from = Also causes the price of $CRV to rise
-Another convenience option for you to offer to your users to make their lives easier for investing",,,

Pairing StakeWiseâ€™s and Lidoâ€™s staked ETH tokens, both of which are pegged 1-to-1 with each other and ETH, allows LPs to earn staking yields on both assets within the pool. sETH2 and stETH are important assets within the ETH ecosystem and this liquidity pool will ensure efficient liquidity between staked ETH tokens as their importance grows over time.

I posted the XSTUSD-3CRV governance proposal on Curve forum and I am responsible for managing the process and getting us added to the Gauge controller.
I woke up to Fiddy's tweet about not trusting it and giving us a NO vote.
This is terrible, as the builders behind XSTUSD/SORA/XOR are legit (a +100 FTE fintech company celebrating 6 years, built the world's first CBDC payment system BAKONG, Polkadot core contributor since 2018, builders of Hyperledges Iroha which has been contributed to the Linux Foundation etc.).
They like to build most things in-house, just like the Oracle. It is built-in in Polkaswap DEX and uses the XOR-DAI price for XSTUSD. There are no external Oracles like Link, and the Oracle is audited and approved, nothing shady about it.

The other points Fiddy makes are mine and community members' honest mistakes.
I shared the governance post from Curve Forum with our community and a few enthusiastic members replied on it, like they do with everything we share. We were not familiar with best/common practices on Curve Forum.

About the bribes: this was also an honest mistake from my side: I did not know about the Convex Snapshot part of the voting process so I asked a community member to try https://bribe.vetoken.finance for bribing, as everything seems to be around bribing. He tested the waters with some bribes under $10k total. Then I understood how it works with Convex Snapshot, we went to sleep and woke up with Fiddyâ€™s tweet. Painful, and I feel especially bad towards the people who worked for weeks on this and trusted me with the process.

Can you and other assessment makers and strong protectors of the protocol be open for a group call or chat with our CEO/Founder of SORAMITSU? He is also the brain behind XSTUSD. https://soramitsu.co.jp 
He alsready replied to FIddy's tweet (Makoto Takemiya)

The price rate used for XSTUSD is the XOR-DAI price on Polkaswap. It is averaged over 30 blocks, with a maximum rate of change per block of 0.197% upwards and 0.007% downwards. The value of XSTUSD is guaranteed by minting XOR at the calculated XOR-DAI rate, so it will always return tokens at the value of the stable coin at the current rate, without slippage. In other words, XSTUSD is not bounded by the pool liquidity, but at least for exiting to XOR has infinite liquidity.

Because the XOR-DAI rate is internal to Polkaswap, there are no oracle operators reporting the price, as it is built into the system.",,,

The audit was done for the curve gauge proposal, about 3 months after XSTUSD went into production, so it would have been quite bad if there had been any exploits. The code itself was tested for 4 months before release, including on our public testnet.

Iâ€™m happy to share the source code or walk through it in a call if you like.

This said, the XSTUSD is not relying on real world data  averaging information from different nodes, but only relaying in the DAI price feed, so our layer of risk regarding the dolar price is directly related with the layer of risk of  DAI.

The price used for a USD oracle is the XOR-DAI price on https://Polkaswap.io. Because Polkaswap is an xyk constant product DEX, it is not expected to have sharp declines or surges, but rather smoother dynamics as xyk punishes price movement with a greater price impact the more you get away from the initial price point.

Aragon is creating a set of 'success case' case studies of leading DAOs, and in the first set would love to cover Curve (we'll also be covering Lido and Decentraland). The case would be a short article explaining how Curve is set up today, as well as a light story of your journey to this point. The objective is to inspire new DAOs to be able to learn from Curve's experience. 

Would anyone be open to this? If so, we'd like to set up a 45 minute call with our marketing team (Lia and Harry) to interview you, and we'd send the draft of the article over to you for your review before publishing.",,"ğŸ¤” (1),âœ?(1)",

I wanted to take a few minutes to let you know about Forta and how it can benefit the Curve community. The Forta Network is a decentralized security network monitoring blockchain activity for threats and anomalies. Think of Forta as a giant security camera and alarm system for Web 3!

Real-time monitoring is a critical pillar of any protocolâ€™s security program, and should supplement your audits and bug bounty programs. The Forta Network is currently securing over $20B of TVL across top projects like MakerDAO, Compound and Lido, and being used to early-detect exploits and other suspicious activity. 

Since Forta is a permissionless network, in some cases teams are developing and deploying their own monitoring bots directly on the network. In other cases, projects are issuing grants or bounties to their community for Forta integration.  

Hereâ€™s an example of the bots currently running on Forta (developed by community members) monitoring specific Curve activity today: https://app.forta.network/agents/curve. 

Weâ€™re interested in working more closely with your core team and community and excited to hear any feedback and questions.",,,

7.77E+17,mintmantemope,2022/7/28 ä¸Šåˆ11:04,2022/7/28,i'm just trying to get a better understanding of what the scope of governance is,,,

7.77E+17,mintmantemope,2022/7/28 ä¸Šåˆ11:05,2022/7/28,because rn its all just adding gauges,,,

7.77E+17,mintmantemope,2022/7/28 ä¸‹åˆ12:12,2022/7/28,as in there is some sort of smart contract that automatically deploys the changes if the proposal is approved (probably following a timelock) rather than relying on a multisig to then implement the change,,,
7.77E+17,mintmantemope,2022/7/28 ä¸‹åˆ12:13,2022/7/28,"for example, Compound's Governor Bravo. I believe Aragon also offers this",,,

7.77E+17,mintmantemope,2022/7/28 ä¸‹åˆ12:22,2022/7/28,and then is there ever a case where a snapshot vote alone would leave to changes to the protocol? No right. It has to be done via a DAO proposal?,,,

7.77E+17,mintmantemope,2022/7/28 ä¸‹åˆ12:23,2022/7/28,"okay cool, that's very helpful, thank you!",,,
7.77E+17,mintmantemope,2022/7/28 ä¸‹åˆ12:24,2022/7/28,"just to provide context for why I'm asking, I'm interested in better understanding the underlying mechanics of various DeFi governance mechanisms. There are a lot that have governance, but are then reliant on devs with multisigs to actually implement changes - meaning the multisig holders could reject the vote if they don't agree even if that's different from the community opinion",,,
7.77E+17,mintmantemope,2022/7/28 ä¸‹åˆ12:24,2022/7/28,it appears you can't do that on curve - except if the emergency multisig is used,,,
7.39E+17,chanho,2022/7/28 ä¸‹åˆ12:26,2022/7/28,"well, like i explained above, that's complicated",,,
7.39E+17,chanho,2022/7/28 ä¸‹åˆ12:26,2022/7/28,depends what changes you are talking about,,,
7.39E+17,chanho,2022/7/28 ä¸‹åˆ12:27,2022/7/28,there are standard proposals which are completely mechanized at this point through aragon,,,
7.39E+17,chanho,2022/7/28 ä¸‹åˆ12:27,2022/7/28,"then there are, ""I want to add random stuff to the protocol"" which you brought up",,,
7.39E+17,chanho,2022/7/28 ä¸‹åˆ12:28,2022/7/28,this includes stuff like adding curve to sidechains,,,
7.77E+17,mintmantemope,2022/7/28 ä¸‹åˆ12:28,2022/7/28,"So in the latter case, it'd probably go something like: 

Snapshot -> DAO Proposal -> Implementation by the team",,,
7.39E+17,chanho,2022/7/28 ä¸‹åˆ12:29,2022/7/28,"yeah, or implementation by whomever the DAO designates",,,
7.39E+17,chanho,2022/7/28 ä¸‹åˆ12:29,2022/7/28,there's absolutely no reason it *has* to be Curve core team,,,
7.77E+17,mintmantemope,2022/7/28 ä¸‹åˆ12:29,2022/7/28,okay that makes a lot of sense. So even in that case the DAO is specifying who does implementation so they are in essence granting control to those people to make the update,,,
7.77E+17,mintmantemope,2022/7/28 ä¸‹åˆ12:29,2022/7/28,do any recent examples come to mind off the top of your head?,,,

4.26E+17,pilotvietnam,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ2:49,2022/8/1,ha he would love that,,,
7.77E+17,mintmantemope,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ2:49,2022/8/1,this seems to be my major conclusion so far:,,,
7.77E+17,mintmantemope,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ2:49,2022/8/1,"Curve is one of the best examples of the intersection of DeFi and governance. Governance plays a critical role in dictating the yield of CRV holders by controlling how CRV emissions are distributed. This has spawned new protocols like Convex that manage yield optimization but require users to forfeit their governance power (remember, cvxCRV holders earn a higher yield but do not have the same governance rights as veCRV). On top of that, protocols like Votium then enable protocols to bribe users for their votes, reinforcing the role of yield as the primary driver of decision making. In short, the feedback loop between yield and governance is so directly correlated that governance on Curve is driven by yield above all else. Higher yields lead to more concentrated liquidity which leads to lower slippage â€?the major value proposition of Curve",,ğŸ”¥ (1),
4.26E+17,pilotvietnam,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ2:50,2022/8/1,"i'd say maybe on protocol being whitelisted and having a majority of the voting power which we have seen, but Convex manages it well and users, with vlCVX, can vote.",,,
4.26E+17,pilotvietnam,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ2:51,2022/8/1,"Another is bribes. While additional rewards are great for users, it can influence more rewards being directed to gauges that don't necessarily do much volume and thus do not generate much in fees for veCRV holders",,,
7.77E+17,mintmantemope,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ2:51,2022/8/1,"ah, that's an excellent point",,,
4.26E+17,pilotvietnam,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ2:52,2022/8/1,"Also side note to what you said about, cvxCRV holders don't have voting power, but protocols like Stake DAO for example, allow you to vote, on gauges and proposals, along with receive rewards, and bribes with sdCRV. So works a bit differently I guess but can have many benefits. Guess the downside is they have approximately 16m CRV locked so their liquidity pool is not huge.",,,
7.77E+17,mintmantemope,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ2:53,2022/8/1,"ah interesting, okay good to know, had not seen that",,,
7.39E+17,chanho,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ2:55,2022/8/1,I would distinguish fees from yield in general,,,
7.39E+17,chanho,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ2:56,2022/8/1,"fees do play a special role in governance, I think, because they are a clearer indication of what is ""good"" for the system than say a token that pumps",,,
7.39E+17,chanho,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ2:57,2022/8/1,"free market philosophy does play a role in the curve ethos, I would say",,,
7.39E+17,chanho,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ2:58,2022/8/1,"however in a well functioning market, you shouldn't be making money unless you are providing value",,,
7.39E+17,chanho,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ2:58,2022/8/1,"since curve's primary service is providing liquidity, fees point toward where you are contributing more to defi",,,
7.77E+17,mintmantemope,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ2:59,2022/8/1,"yea i would think that if there are not very many fees than the apy for the pool would be way down since the only yield would be coming from CRV emissions and any bribes, which will not be sustainable for the bribing protocol over a longer period of time",,,
7.77E+17,mintmantemope,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ2:59,2022/8/1,but could work for a short period of time,,,

7.77E+17,mintmantemope,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ3:06,2022/8/1,"awesome, ty ser",,,
7.77E+17,mintmantemope,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ3:06,2022/8/1,one other thing that comes to mind is a situation like frax where they have accumulated so much CRV that they now are basically entrenched in their position and it would be hard to kick them out,,,
7.77E+17,mintmantemope,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ3:06,2022/8/1,since they are earning so much CRV emissions,,,
4.26E+17,pilotvietnam,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ3:09,2022/8/1,"Yes. They used to dump their CRV for CVX I believe but have since whitelisted. I think they will lock some CRV, but may continue to accumulate CVX. This has allowed them to offer bribes and basically reach about 25% of emissions to it's gauges across multiple protocols. I won't get into it too much here, but if you look at their volume levels, they are not huge performers.",,,
7.77E+17,mintmantemope,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ3:10,2022/8/1,"sorry, when you say whitelisted you mean?",,,
4.26E+17,pilotvietnam,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ3:14,2022/8/1,"mean Frax can lock CRV and boost directly as a protocol if they wish. Convex, Stake DAO and Frax, Liquidity, Abracadabra are whitelisted",,,
4.26E+17,pilotvietnam,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ3:14,2022/8/1,I think Maker may put in a proposal soon as well,,,

7.39E+17,chanho,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ3:18,2022/8/1,"Anyway, the whitelist privilege allows a smart contract to lock CRV",,,
7.39E+17,chanho,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ3:18,2022/8/1,So far this has been for two things: to allow a DAO multisig contract to do treasury management and vote,,,
7.39E+17,chanho,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ3:19,2022/8/1,And to allow a protocol to wrap CRV into its own tokenized veCRV,,,
7.39E+17,chanho,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ3:19,2022/8/1,First level requires trust still but less than the second,,,
7.39E+17,chanho,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ3:20,2022/8/1,Iâ€™m a pleb because I donâ€™t think the DAO will just vote fo whitelist random multisig I create,,,
7.77E+17,mintmantemope,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ3:21,2022/8/1,"haha i see, so frax can replicate what convex is doing on their own protocol essentially",,,
4.26E+17,pilotvietnam,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ3:22,2022/8/1,Yes they could/can,,,
7.77E+17,mintmantemope,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ3:23,2022/8/1,an right now it looks like Frax is getting about 32% of all CRV emissions on a daily basis?,,,
4.26E+17,pilotvietnam,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ3:23,2022/8/1,Yes,,,
4.26E+17,pilotvietnam,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ3:24,2022/8/1,"but when you compare their volume across all of their pools to say, something similiar, you'll see what i was alluding to above",,,
7.77E+17,mintmantemope,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ3:26,2022/8/1,"interesting, and actually the frax CRV apy is less than something like tether",,,
7.77E+17,mintmantemope,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ3:26,2022/8/1,so that implies that they are subsidizing yield through bribing?,,,
7.39E+17,chanho,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ3:33,2022/8/1,"wouldn't want to jump to any conclusions here.. been a while since I checked them out, but there has been some inefficiencies noted in the FRAX direction",,,

7.39E+17,chanho,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ4:00,2022/8/1,however it does come with some additional risk,,,
7.77E+17,mintmantemope,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ4:05,2022/8/1,"This does raise concerns over the entrenchment of governance power, particularly as it relates to the directing of CRV emissions. A protocol that accumulates significant CRV â€?they could do this through being a LP, buying CRV off secondary markets, or using other protocols like Convex â€?can more cheaply attract future liquidity because they can allocate more CRV emissions to their liquidity pools. This creates a flywheel where users are incentivized to provide liquidity to earn more CRV, which in turns increases the amount of CRV rewards the protocol earns, which then enables them to provide even more rewards to liquidity providers. Frax has pursued this strategy aggressively and now receives ~32% of all newly emitted CRV even though it only accounts for just over 1% of total volume on the Curve protocol. This raises questions over the role of governance in directing CRV emissions to the most used liquidity pools rather than the ones able to provide the highest yield. 

In 2021, a DeFi protocol Mochi attempted to implement this flywheel for their protocol. Mochi purchased ~$46 million in CVX to direct more CRV rewards to their liquidity pools and incentivize deeper liquidity. However, shortly after initiating the scheme Curve holders uncovered a number of red flags surrounding Mochi protocolâ€™s operations that prompted concerns over the allocation of so many CRV tokens to a potentially fraudulent protocol. In this case, Curveâ€™s Emergency DAO was able to respond quickly and prevent the Mochi liquidity pool from receiving CRV emissions. The event, however, created significant controversy over the power of the Emergency DAO as well as the ability of questionable protocols to easily hijack CRV emissions.",,,

7.39E+17,chanho,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ4:30,2022/8/1,feel the part about the flywheel is a bit muddled,,,
7.39E+17,chanho,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ4:31,2022/8/1,"> This creates a flywheel where users are incentivized to provide liquidity to earn more CRV, which in turns increases the amount of CRV rewards the protocol earns, which then enables them to provide even more rewards to liquidity providers
just because LPs earn more CRV doesn't increase the amount of CRV emitted to the protocol per se",,,
7.39E+17,chanho,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ4:32,2022/8/1,it's when the protocol is also an LP that they earn more CRV,,,
7.77E+17,mintmantemope,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ4:33,2022/8/1,"ahh, okay, good distinction",,,
7.39E+17,chanho,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ4:33,2022/8/1,so you can bribe voters to direct emissions to your pool(s) but at the same time compare that to the cost of incentivizing directly by giving out your protocol tokens to the LPs,,,
7.39E+17,chanho,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ4:34,2022/8/1,"historically, protocols have found it's cheaper to bribe",,,
7.39E+17,chanho,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ4:34,2022/8/1,however you can go one step further and also be an LP in the pool(s),,,
7.39E+17,chanho,2022/8/1 ä¸‹åˆ4:34,2022/8/1,"then you actually receive CRV emissions yourself, which of course offsets the cost of the bribes",,,

I am contacting you to provide our expertise in governance when it comes to the subject of DAOs. 
We are a team of academic researchers, blockchain developers, lawyers, financiers and political scientists who have been working for over 10 years to develop a scientific paradigm for collective decision making, at the intersection of social choice theory, welfare economics, decentralized artificial intelligence, collective intelligence and strategic marketing. 

We have introduced decision rules that offer expressiveness and usability, robustness in the way they analyze information, limited manipulability and scalability. 

The rules are tailor-made: governors can strategically orient the collective decision between performance, equity and consensuality.
We have solved the Condorcet Paradox: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_paradox 
which is a 200 year old problem on governance. 

I know that there are many pain points in DAOs and the governance of blockchains protocols nowadays and there are still many challenges to overcome regarding:
- Consensus Mechanism
- Tokenization Mechanism
- Voting Mechanism
- Smart Contract Mechanism.

By working with us you will get assured to get the best recommendations/product which fit your market needs.
Do not hesitate to contact me back if this is of interests to you.

Kind Regards.


Vincent

What do people think about a partially anonymous forum? Has anyone censored their controversial ideas due to fear of social reprisals? What have you done if your idea goes against the big players in the DAO? Can partial anonymity be a way to start addressing group think?

I understand that social reputation is important in qualifying the ideas but, it also gets in the way of viewing ideas based on its merits. In certain cases, we censor our controversial comments because it goes against the grain of the majority of DAOs and we tend to not point that out because of fear of social reprisal. Again, this may get in the way of having the most effective decision as some ideas are not considered (and that â€œconsensusâ€?is a more of a capitulation than general agreement that we have the best idea.)

I believe that certain topics may require an anon space to assess the ideas by its merits rather than rely too heavily on the social representation (albeit it has an important role in the DAO).

A hyper-deflationary token where holders can benefit from the deflationary aspect to obtain a larger percentage of the total supply over time. Communities from other protocols can use OBURN to vote for their project, and fight for one of the top 5 spots to earn a buyback and burn of their token! With low-supply governance boosting NFTs, power up your vote by 25%, 50%, or even 100%! 
Coming next year, $ARSON will turn up the heat!

Users are now able to receive notifications relating to swaps on various chains and price changes. Those notifications are customised based on user settings. For example, notify me if there is a swap greater than $xxx between XYZ and other token etc. 

The following makes activity & transactions monitoring easy, which brings a lot of value to the community, That`s why EtherDrops is so popular.

You said it best at the end, however... It's up to the new protocol to convince voters to support this cause when the token being bribed is neither immediately promising nor liquid. 

I am hoping that the Llama Risk team will weigh in and educate veCRV voters with findings and reports during the stages of Governance Proposal, Deploy, and Vote.

The Paladin team is friendly and welcoming. I would like to see @Beguin, who is the gigabrain behind Paladin's Weekly Gauge Newsletter (a SUPER read each week) collaborate on marketing of this concept. In addition to the curve and convex places suggested to market their plan, new projects looking to raise funds this way might be the subject of a ""Weekly Gauge"" article and respond to questions from Beguin.

Because you need to use deposited tokens to improve the profit of any LP, ( I guessed you needed to use tokens which were locked for a period of time from the Minter page, similar to the Locked page.
