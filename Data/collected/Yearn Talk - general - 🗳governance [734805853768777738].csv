Before going into that, if anyone have idea about Synthetix now and how it is grown since last year.

Synthetix firstly had fixed supply of 100 million and they introduced minting model to get supply of sUSD into the market. Intially not much interested to do mint from most of community holders of SNX, because there is no proper incentivisation for them to do the task. But the team didn't give up. And so many discussions happened around discord to increase the supply of SNX to bootstrap the product. Team and community believed that the inflation will outweigh the network effect valuation it brings on table. Now we are seeing the results of this model as perfect mechanism and price of SNX increased significantly from 0.05cents to 3.6$. Now it becomes a perfect example to every other DeFi projects whoever wants to get their project bootstrap by their community. Recent Projects as Examples : Balancer, Curve, mStable, COMP, Kava etc.,. 

Not only this, incentivisation for LP also introduced by Synthetix in first for sETH/ETH liquidity to get into the Synthetix ecosystem from Crypto world.

From the above what we can understand is Inflation is necessary to get the attention of crypto community towards to the project. And Network effect valuation will definitely outweigh the inflation if the project has more to offer to its community in the future. This will bring more valuation to YFI price.

I suggest YFI should be having inflationary which in decreasing trend in a curved manner(gradual decrease) instead of step manner(sudden decrease).",,,,,,

@psybull | YFI-maxi I agree that it would have been a cool experiment, but if i understand correctly, Leshner also became a gajillionaire due to an inflationary scheme lol. Itâ€™s easy for him to tell the project that he has no stake in to try the experiment that probably wonâ€™t work. If yfi is the â€œlittle guyâ€™sâ€?one chance to control a network rather than a small group of vcs, it would be a shame to waste it on an experiment that might fail imo. we should try as hard as we can to get our incentivizing game right.",,pepe_laugh (1),,,,

@yfi_whale  i still like this idea: for instance start with 60-70% yfi rewards per year so the most liquidity will probably stay.
but 60-70% will only play out IF yfi has some value and price stays or will go up. thats where the idea of collecting all fees, bal and crv only with staked yfi comes into play.

Keeping the float small also helps with price appreciation.  It also attracts more of the sound money crew.  The project is good enough that people would still use it even if not subsidized with YFI.  Paying for usage may be bad because fair-weather farmers would flee to the next highest yielding play with a crop rotation the moment that it happens.

Other projects were able to have price increases even though inflation existed; maybe don't fix what ain't broke.  Disallowing future farming may cause the community to feel bad in that large whales will always hold a certain percentage of the float unless they sell and there is no other way to get YFI.

* 2) Liquidity Provision (Allow anyone ease of entry to the ecosystem/YFI)
* 3) Governance Participation
* 4) Developers
* 5) Reserve, Can be used to cover the Safety of protocol (Audits /Insurance etc) and development grants for community

3) The weightage of the 80/20 YFI/yCRV pool from 2/98 YFI/yCRV might be too drastic of a shift immediately, how about a tiered transition from 98/2 yCRV/YFI -> 80/20 yCRV/YFI -> 60/40 yCRV/YFI 
a) A shift to 80/20 exposes LPs to a lot of price fluctuations
b) Would lead to a large underutilised yCRV which we do not want in the ecosystem
c) We still want YFI holders to have a larger say than say Stablecoin whales, which was my original thinking from shifting to 80/20 YFI/yCRV

The latter is volatile the former is not. Secondly, for users/LPs, I think a valid point was made about limiting LP exposure to fluctuations and properly utilizing yCRV. So 60/40 or 80/20 yCRV/YFI seem sensible. The other issue with an 80/20 YFI/yCRV pool, participation in which I presume is required for voting, will exclude small holders from governance participation a bit--since it will force folks who have not earned YFI to buy more or convert their yCRV into YFI--which is far riskier.

The rate should eventually tend higher as the protocol becomes more robust and time tested, the risk for the liquidity providers will drop and negotiations can happen to raise the YFI proportion in the pool to reduce impermanent loss.  Keeping it as is 2/98 racks up a ton of impermanent loss on price appreciation.

Right now it is best to give chance to vote for those who have earned YFI till now by taking large smart contract risks.

This model is conceptually similar to the assumed distribution of Curve.fi's governance tokens, which will be paid out to liquidity providers who have been active since the projectâ€™s inception.  Signalling this publicly would help prevent a a feared mass exodus of liquidity from the y.curve pool while the community continues to discuss monetary policy and emission schedules.

@UltraSoundMonkey indeed. I would substitute it with a form of vote delegation.there are issues in which I, for example, do not have an inform enough opinion to vote.

YFI looks like a great project, endorsing governance with a token that hasn't been premined.
Within a week near 30k tokens were mined allowing owners to choose the direction of the project.
I understand the reason of keeping the supply low to reward early adopters but we are talking about a project that has been live around a week. 
Sure crypto moves fast but doesn't that seem extremely short for adoption and teaching others what is YFI? Wouldn't giving more incentive to newcomers make the whole system healthier?
The 2 sides are extremes:
- Adopter since day 0 dont want to have their share diluted, a lot of hype around the project
- newcomer, wants to participate but tokens already cost way more than anticipated

Maybe I'm missing something, is there a reason why to keep the issuance of another 20k over 5/10 years reasonable?

Just trying to understand both sides of the coin.

Hear me out:
- Currently, early adopters are rewarded as they hold the majority of tokens. But given a weeks notice to mine, seems extreme
- If the issuance is stretched out in a month or 2. Rewards don't necessarily have to be as high as initial week but large enough to incentivise new comers.
- Holding that model, newcomers get their share of the cake, early adopters will keep mining reducing the dilution of their governing power. It will decrease, yes, but to enable a somewhat larger number of token holders.
1-2 months gives enough time to document the whole YFI project /experiment, allows people to decide whether they want to get involved or not and correctly assess risks of joining the governance.",,,,,,

@Mr. Pink  I think it has more to do with acting quickly to unexpected problems. Which is when we need to be able to reach a majority quickly.

@Mr. Pink It's not that we will create people with autocratic power, it's that they will always emerge in any system, and where we can make a difference is whether we recognize those positions of power and formalize them, so that we can constrain their power and define ways the system owners (in our case YFI holders) can punish/oust them if they become malicious.",,ğŸ’¯ (1),,,,

4.56227E+17,Deleted User,2020/7/30 ä¸‹åˆ8:14,2020/7/30 ,"@Substreight I am a brainlet, I would like some help on it. I will try to explain my thinking. Hopefully some kind of discourse is spawned from this.

Currently we have nexus mutual as an option for insurance. That system, for valid reasons, requires KYC. I personally (and Iâ€™m sure many others) are not interested in the product because of the KYC aspect.

One good thing about using nexus mutual is it insures the contracts themselves, so it covers people locking up funds in yVault etc.

I donâ€™t think buying put options on YFI could match what nexus covers, since YFI value is distinct from stable coin value risked.

But I guess why I bring this up is that buying into YFI implicitly means you are exposed to the similar risks that liquidity providers are exposed to. If liquidity providers lose funds to a bug, not necessarily because of the yearn contracts but some other DeFi contract, then the YFI token presumably loses value 

If there were no way for YFI holders, specifically those YFI holders that want to exercise governance rights, to protect the value they possess during such a scenario, then could that mean that governance itself could fall apart? What I mean is that would people sell and not have any reason to govern any more and effectively kill the project?

I hope this isnâ€™t too hypothetical of a scenario",,,,,,
4.56227E+17,Deleted User,2020/7/30 ä¸‹åˆ8:24,2020/7/30 ,"So as for what this could look like:

Some portion of the issuance  could be sent to an options protocol. The YFI would be locked up and used as collateral for the market. 

This has multiple benefits. One would be it signals a commitment to security. Another would be it actually provides some level of security. And the final I can think of is it can show people that itâ€™s not a bad idea to sell options on their YFI, making the insurance on YFI itself better for us all. 

The reason why this wouldnâ€™t make sense I guess is the issuance dedicated  is minuscule compared to the amount of YFI circulating. But I argue that itâ€™s good for a large portion of people since theyâ€™re not going to be whales anyway

I may think of some more thing but I hope this is enough for now. Like I said Iâ€™m somewhat of a brainlet so Iâ€™m happy to hear why this doesnâ€™t make sense",,,,,,

@Obnauticus I agree, and I'm interested to see how it plays out.

At the other end, you have mStable. VC backed, closed. Their Discord has six channels, instead of the 25+ and growing here. Their product is so slick to use.

1.18186E+17,kiwi.eth,2020/8/2 ä¸Šåˆ10:38,2020/8/2 ,One of the largest issues is this stacking of proposals imo,,,,,,
1.18186E+17,kiwi.eth,2020/8/2 ä¸Šåˆ10:38,2020/8/2 ,Proposals should be sequential,,,,,,
5.30196E+17,j_larrieux,2020/8/2 ä¸Šåˆ10:38,2020/8/2 ,We can approximate based on 15 seconds block number.... Doing weekdays only just complicate things,,,,,,
1.18186E+17,kiwi.eth,2020/8/2 ä¸Šåˆ10:38,2020/8/2 ,Not stacked on top of eachother,,,,,,

6.37715E+17,â˜†crybabyâ˜?5480,2020/8/2 ä¸Šåˆ10:39,2020/8/2 ,I could see proposals settling down,,,,,,
1.18186E+17,kiwi.eth,2020/8/2 ä¸Šåˆ10:39,2020/8/2 ,"Hm, we can always encofrce it socially",,,,,,
1.18186E+17,kiwi.eth,2020/8/2 ä¸Šåˆ10:39,2020/8/2 ,But it's been a regular occurrence,,,,,,
1.18186E+17,kiwi.eth,2020/8/2 ä¸Šåˆ10:39,2020/8/2 ,But yeah maybe it'll be less of a problem,,,,,,
6.37715E+17,â˜†crybabyâ˜?5480,2020/8/2 ä¸Šåˆ10:39,2020/8/2 ,Maybe you need a quorum to put forth a vote,,,,,,
6.37715E+17,â˜†crybabyâ˜?5480,2020/8/2 ä¸Šåˆ10:40,2020/8/2 ,Like 10%,,,,,,

6.37715E+17,â˜†crybabyâ˜?5480,2020/8/2 ä¸Šåˆ10:40,2020/8/2 ,So you need to socially collect a group to even put one together,,,,,,
1.18186E+17,kiwi.eth,2020/8/2 ä¸Šåˆ10:40,2020/8/2 ,It's a bit more code complexity though,,,,,,
6.37715E+17,â˜†crybabyâ˜?5480,2020/8/2 ä¸Šåˆ10:40,2020/8/2 ,And then the top one is run that week?,,,,,,

So if you have yfi tokens, to earn your share of fees, you have to stake them via the ygov V2 website.

Then in order to actually receive rewards you have to vote on a proposal first and then wait 3 days?

If there are no proposals, the fees just keep piling up in the background waiting for another vote before they can be dispersed?

@banteg wow, first of all no one attacked or even mentioned Andre, and why would they.  He put forward three different proposals, and then drafted this one when it was the favorite in informal polling.  We don't even know if he supports it.  But second, your comment reads like something straight out of a business ethics textbook.

@banteg I don't think anyone wants to attack Andre personally. Or YFI. The inclusion of the 2nd option in the proposal was probably what set a lot of people off. Frankly that was a really bad idea. Just the perception that YFI was considering to just take it and put it into the treasury clouded everything. As it stands, It seems like the lock option is reasonable.

atm. our base strategy is to farm and dump to increase the # of base asset we farm with. which gives us great ROI and awesome for everyone using the vaults
as a negative side we put a huge sell pressure on the projects we use and I think we started to get some sort of a bad name on the projects we benefit from (where ever we rotate our liquidity, the price drops)... looking at the cream and crv we basically hurt the fellow farmers (especially the smaller ones)... low roi + low capital + high gas fees, we basically force people to join us or become non-profitable...

Even though this strategy  is highly profitable atm. This farming craze will end at some point and I think we should start positioning ourselves in a way we can influence the future of the defi in a way to benefit us the most...

Idea dump:
- add an additional parameter to vaults where we can determine the % of the yield we keep (eg: we keep 25% of the yield and dump the rest 75%)
- we put those gov. tokens in the tresury and play an active role on the future of those protocols. 
- maybe select ambassadors who are interested in the dealings of those protocols and incentivize them to communicate in the best interest of YFI.  eg: if we had ~10-15% of the total crv supply we'd have a good amount of power over the protocol to influence the future of the project...
- every YFI holder has a claim on the % of those tokens. let's say if you have 1% of the YFI you have claim on 0.75% of the loot. (the 25% for the warchest maybe?)
- YFI holders can ragequit and sell their YFI back to the system and get their claim. that YFI can either be added back to the be `re-farmed` or distributed equally amongst the people who stake YFI.",,,,,,

@GEBucky  not sure what youâ€™re trying to say, could you expand?",,,,,,
4.27726E+17,GEBucky#1736,2020/8/24 ä¸Šåˆ6:09,2020/8/24 ,"> Sure. Hereâ€™s a better argument. tvl in yfi is 1b. Market cap of yfi is 390m. So i could buy 51% of yfi for say 200m (feel free to scale this up to whatever price of yfi you feel is fair), vote to funnel all the money to me and profit 800m. Except... I cant, because yfi has no governing power. So in other words, if yfi actually had on chain governing power, its value would skyrocket (s.t. the arbitrage would not be profitable). As a yfi hodler i would really enjoy that.

I really don't like the idea of this protocol having a 'lead dev' - would prefer having a few lead editors. 
Here are ways that could work:  

- A bounty system: % of dev grants allocated per YIP depending on a variable like front end or vault code. this way we know how much each YIP will cost and not just vote ""yes"" on everything. after YIP is passed, code will be voted on. Whoever gets there first / has the ideal code gets % dev grant bounty. 
- Normalize code being drafted before YIP is passed: If the code doesn't need too much work, then the person who pitched will receive % dev grant at the lead editors' discretion

In this system, Andre could be a lead editor with a steady income, be paid for bounties if he can code it fast and the best or he could draft code before pitching. 

In my opinion, what's best for longevity is to incentivize creativity and hard work. We are fortunate to be participating in an open protocol where any dev can make a name for themselves. We want to attract creative people and ensure that they will get paid for being better than others. In this system, Andre will also be able to innovate without the protocol revolving around him. 

Consider that he says he gets bored from things easily and likes to move on when a puzzle is solved.",,,,,,

@rock 

If you're in the gov staking pool, you'll affect the quorum needed. So, in some cases, if many people aren't voting, your vote may still be important. (e.g. see how YIP 43 was rejected due to lack of quorum.)

> with decay you can't do that
@banteg My problem with weight decay is you have to constantly refresh your ""lock"" like currently on veCRV

But now that I think about it some more, this problem can be easily avoided by doing the following:

1. Send YFI to SC with ""infinite lock time"" while also telling it how much time-weight you want (say 1 yr)
2. The SC doesn't automatically allow you to withdraw after 1 yr, and your weight doesn't decay. Instead,
3. You call an SC ""withdraw-signal"" function which tells it to unlock your YFI within a year. Only when this function is called, your weight starts decaying
4. You get to collect your YFI either on a timed-release or at the end of that 1yr

Example:
1. Wallet A tells SC it wants the maximum weight (say 1yr), but really, Wallet A wants to stake for 2 years and doesn't want to constantly refresh their stake during the first year
2. Wallet A lets YFI sit in the SC for a year, without interaction with the SC (gas). The SC doesn't decay their weight because the ""withdraw-signal"" function haven't been called
3. Wallet A calls ""withdraw-signal"" after year 1 is up, planning to withdraw at the end of year 2
4. SC processes the call, starts decaying weight
5. Wallet A collects time-released YFI or the whole lump sum at the end of year 2",,,,,,
1.97856E+17,beepidibop,2020/9/12 ä¸Šåˆ8:05,2020/9/12 ,"Edit: On deposit, the staker can tell the SC how long their ""withdraw-signal"" should last, and that is used to determine their weight.

Example:
1. Wallet B haven't made up their mind on how long to stake, but figures a 3day notice satisfy their needs.
2. Wallet B tells the SC their withdraw-signal should be 3 days long while depositing, SC determines their weight to be 3 days.
3. Wallet B goes MIA for 6 months, weight doesn't decay (still remaining 3 days).
4. Wallet B signals after 6 months, retrieve coins in 6months+3days, while having 3day weight up until 6months, and start decaying when the ""withdraw-signal"" is called.

And there should probably be a function that lengthens your signal period so you don't have to wait to unstake then stake again . But there shouldn't be one for shortening the period",,,,,,

@banteg I'd view it more akin to a sort of vesting period for the staking. E.G. voting power (and commensurate rewards) goes from 0.5 -> 2 over the course of a year, and caps out there.  That way folks are incentivized to leave their YFI in the governance for a longer period of time, and external antagonists who want to snap up YFI, maliciously vote, and then flee will have a reduced vote capacity.",,,,,,

@Tummler I'm for permanently removing the ability to mint YFI for the reasons you've stated. Just wondering whether it'd be beneficial for Andre to receive even a modest amount like 30 YFI (which is not really modest) prior to eventually removing the ability to mint. I know that Andre's voice is usually enough to influence proposals but an ownership of additional YFI by Andre may impart some benefit of which I hope someone can articulate better than I can

@timbit If he doesn't want it I don't think he will use it in voting. Additionally, he would need to stake it and vote with it which isn't necessarily implied even if it is minted and sent to him so it doesn't really correlate to having more skin in the game IMO.

From what I understand, the only way to claim your rewards is to vote on a proposal. However, if there are no proposals, rewards are effectively locked for an unforseable time. 

Would it be possible to set up a system where stakers are able to claim rewards at predetermined times regardless of there being a proposal to vote. I can see ""empty"" proposals happening just so stakers could claim rewards.  Maybe have the system set up for every Yearly Quarter a harvest proposal happens so stakers have an option. This would allow stakers to not depend on proposals to happen to claim their rewards.

Hope that makes sense. I posted in the yip planning but I'm not sure if that was the right room -_-",,,,,,

@dripdrop WOOFYFI 10BTC 

Let me try to summarise so far. 

LearnYearn, here: (https://www.learnyearn.finance/start-here/yfi-revenue-model) states that it is fee generation that is contributing to the treasury.

Anything above $500k into the treasury will start paying out fees to YFI token holders. 

The address for the treasury is the following: 

https://etherscan.io/address/0xfeb4acf3df3cdea7399794d0869ef76a6efaff52#internaltx

If you look at the cumulative value held in the treasury over time, you  can see that it only once blips above $500k

So that would suggest that reward payments should have only happened once. 

However as mentioned by @Bob_The_Buidler | YFIStats.com People have actually been getting paid for staking even when the treasury is not above $500k. At least currently through the Earn product or through the Ycrv withdrawal fees as @dripdrop WOOFYFI 10BTC mentions. 

Then I have a question:

>Is there any YiP or anything written by the developers that explains the current reward mechanisms for staking? So we can get clarity and try to predict how this may scale in the future.",,,,,,
7.50961E+17,.toranagasama,2020/9/20 ä¸Šåˆ6:02,2020/9/20 ,"Thanks for the summary @LivioRazlo 

I think that perhaps one of the first steps (and perhaps I'm behind here) is to figure out how to communicate with those responsible for administration of the multisig. They have a responsibility to answer these questions for the community. And if they have answered them already, they have a responsibility to share this information in a way that is transparent (back to the poor comms issue). 

There is a consistent flow of funds leaving the Treasury - where are these going? Is it in line with the proposed budget? Decentralised is only any good if those in positions of responsibility are transparent. It's not that I believe they aren't being transparent, it's just there is so much going on that nothing is organised. 

Also, I believe that rewards/dividends are paid out of the Governance contract, not the Treasury. That can be found here: https://etherscan.io/address/0xBa37B002AbaFDd8E89a1995dA52740bbC013D992

@LivioRazlo :yikes:  i didn't even read everything you typed, but you are overthinking it!!
treasury is below 500k, but that number was a guideline - there is no mechanism to actually keep it exactly to 500k and stream fees to it automatically for refill. it is also unable to deal with assets other than yCRV coming in, so there are different things accumulating. Banteg is building treasury v2, which will be able to convert things into yUSD, stream rewards to vaults strategy creators (i think), maintain the 500k (btw, this is a temporary solution for 6 months only, we will revisit the number before then).

@mjc716 yeah I think that's something we'll have to discuss if we go that route. My suggestion was using random snapshot within like a one-week span, or use a snapshot several days in the past.

@fewture In the long run that's not actually a bad idea.  To somehow make all code changes timelocked by 24-48 hours in case of a bad actor or a takeover of the gov pool by bad actors trying to steel the money in the pools.

Here are a few options based on feedback. They are mockups â€?a little too lo-res and would need cleanup, etc. 

They are all darker than the first pass. I tweaked the radius of the â€œsmileâ€?to make it less Amazon, and more in line with yUSD. 

I think I like 1a and 2a best. Itâ€™s a cleaner read. They are the same design and could both be used as needed.

That said, the rotation with the sideways smile is fun and could be more memorable. The only worry I have there is we risk limiting future design as we are tying ourselves to the smile design element, and a particular direction or placement of the element. But if others love it, Iâ€™m in!

I think the tweak to the arrow addressed the note that inspired 1c, but I threw it on there. 2c doesnâ€™t really work for me. I canâ€™t unsee a one-eyed monster of some sort.

1.3951E+17,kx9x,2020/9/29 ä¸Šåˆ11:09,2020/9/29 ,obviously depends on the liquidity available,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2020/9/29 ä¸Šåˆ11:09,2020/9/29 ,but they have options,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2020/9/29 ä¸Šåˆ11:09,2020/9/29 ,also there might have been enough DAI left just to sell directly on the contract,,,,,,

1.3951E+17,kx9x,2020/9/29 ä¸Šåˆ11:09,2020/9/29 ,because your friend bought EMN (which puts money into the bonding curve),,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2020/9/29 ä¸Šåˆ11:09,2020/9/29 ,you can just get that back by calling sell,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2020/9/29 ä¸Šåˆ11:11,2020/9/29 ,"if they bought on a shit ton on uniswap, then there is possibility that the bonding curve wasn't solvent enough to swap back (and they got a terrible price). but really, after the exploit anyone interacting with the contract afterwards could easily see the manipulated token supply",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2020/9/29 ä¸Šåˆ11:11,2020/9/29 ,"and if you happened to buy, you would notice that the amount of EMN you got was wack and then be able to call sell right after to get all your money back that you put in",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2020/9/29 ä¸Šåˆ11:12,2020/9/29 ,"As for the people before the exploit, they bought X EMN before the exploit and then boom, the exploit hit and the EMN was worth a small percentage less than it was before.

1.3951E+17,kx9x,2020/9/29 ä¸Šåˆ11:12,2020/9/29 ,so it is pretty obvious to me that the fair option is refunding the block before the exploit,,,,,,

1.3951E+17,kx9x,2020/9/29 ä¸Šåˆ11:13,2020/9/29 ,or even make a ton of profit by arbing on Uniswap,,,,,,

3.76594E+17,john patten#2334,2020/9/29 ä¸‹åˆ12:52,2020/9/29 ,"i posted this in general but i think this is a better fit here (so switching it here):

what if you had a distribution mechanism in place
that randomized the method for a certain amount of time at the beginning of the project (eg, a month)?
for instance, there's a theory that a line goes fastest if the last person is served first as opposed to first in, first out
if you made it so being earliest to the distribution was either the best or worst time to join--and no one knew ahead of time which it would be-- it might prevent the ""crowding"" by in-the-know people at the genesis of a project
governance could decide on the boundaries for randomization for what would be acceptable in the most extreme circumstances (party <x> controlling as much as <y%> or as little as <z%> of the supply)

it would be in the best interest of someone who wants to increase the value of their investment to focus on the project solely, because they can't maximize their advantage through timing alone.. which would mean encouraging others to be early adopters

you could also put some randomize function to account for the number of participants. like, as the number of participants grows, the initial distribution either shrinks or grows. so anyone acting out of self-interest would be interested in a ""fair"" distribution that keeps them from being too much or too little of the initial shareholder group

they also don't want to make the distribution so skewed that people don't want to participate, so mutual value creation is the most self-serving outcome",,,,,,

@Bob_The_Buidler | YFIStats.com Haven't calculated actual earned gains APY yet, but will do that at some point. Someone else's calcs are yearn's calcs...so yes, I rely on those so I don't have to go digging into the contract and back-end daily...although I will periodically. Based on your evaluation then...yearn's published numbers are either wrong or not updated in real time.  The yearn vault has consistently displayed lower returns than the gov vault since inception. The majority of users will be using (or at least considering) the vaults UI data to make investment decisions. Regardless...returns either slightly above, slightly below or equal to gov vault means value-add from using the yearn vault mostly amounts to automated yCRV to $YFI convenience at this point.

@banteg 

 A deposit fee removes capital immediately before it can earn yields. In the context of billions TVL, that could result in a sizeable reduction of capital in the vaults earning yield.

Between the incentives issue an and the foregoing analysis, it is hard to beat the simplicity and effectiveness of a simple straightforward withdrawal fee.",,,,,,

Assume $100mm is 10% of FARM TVL at a 15% base APY (excluding farm incentives).   An investor would earn 100mm*15%/52 weeks or 288k normally.  You are giving FARM 30% of that or $86k.  That means you need at least $86k of farm incentives each week to breakeven.  Right now they are issuing 19kish per week (and declining) and if you are 10% of TVL you are getting 19k * 70% (to LP pools) * 10% * $225 FARM price or 300k per week if you dump.  People are just going to keep dumping the token and breakeven will be around $65.   Below that its a death spiral.  Its sort of like a hot-potato (but no one has an incentive to hold).    Also since the amount issued each week declines by 4% that breakeven price gets higher and higher each week.  IMO it's basically a short term boost that will fade.

It should also disincentivize YFI Stakers simply delegating themselves in Departments in which they add no value, since their lack of contribution should be more easily identified and publicly called out by other Department Stakers who are actively contributing in the Department, not only through obvious engagement and participation in Department-specific open forums, but also through the use of systems such as SourceCred (and hopefully other systems) which may serve as a proxy for quantification of Department contributions.",,,,,,

> @tracheopteryx For those who don't work in the unbearable world that is corporate marketing this is corporate speak for ""go fuck yourself, I will never admit anything about this has value because I am better than you"" - Honestly man, you say you have extensive experience at this, but you skipped over what anyone with extensive experience would know is the core part of the strategy and only read the mantra. And then you say ""you'll give me notes"" and ""stick around and find where we can incorporate small parts of your ideas"" - you don't want me here. You're just using corporate psychobabble to say it.  If you have fair feedback I'll listen, but I've been in enough corporate rooms to know that your notes will be are tainted by the fact that if you're in charge of brand marketing and this is something that falls under your purview which makes me an inconvenience. You should have already been identifying core consumer targets, consumer insights that drive those consumers, defining the cultural tension in the world, how Yearn fits into the broader financial category, what the overarching consumer insight is, how the brand can fight to address it and the underlying idea. Banteg said the team was made in September. Maybe this has been on your list since then. But I highly doubt your notes will be worth anyone's time.

You know that the most important function of a brand marketer is to be able to assess creative and strategic ideas... so you decided to skip the entire strategy (mantra was at the end so you had to know you passed the brand house) and not read any of the substance because it wasn't visually to your liking?",,,,,,

Fund manager for the vaults, I think it's out of scope for Yearn. The idea is to trust the code. Code is law. And automate as much as possible, as you can do with Keep3r and that kind of tech.

Pillars are great. I think I've put something similar (much more informal) in a slide I did for a talk. But that's the blockchain. It's not exactly Yearn. For me Yearn shouts: decentralized, collective, on top of ethereum's basic pillars.

The mantra changes are good, I saw as refining what we already say. We are a young project and how we express ourselves is evolving. We try to promote some language or way of saying things, but as we are decentralized, we'd never have only one message. We will have a plural one.",,,,,,

Furthermore, because the MultiSig signers have, thus far, remained the same since theyâ€™ve been empowered (with exception to the few that were swapped out in late August) and the majority of its 9 signers appear to be largely inactive within the Yearn community, Iâ€™m concerned that there is a lack of incentive alignment within the existing MultiSig. Of the 9 active MultiSig signers, on the surface, it appears that only 2 to 4 of them (certainly you and Klim, and maybe Substreight and devops199fan) are active and â€œup-to-speedâ€?enough to make very well-informed decisions about capital allocation. With that said, if this proposal is not the answer (which, once again, I can absolutely see its downsides), Iâ€™d, at the very least, suggest that we find a way to improve activity/engagement of our MultiSig signers until a more solid Treasury Governance plan can be developed. For instance, maybe we can set up a regularly scheduled (weekly? monthly?) vote to re-elect MultiSig signers and swap out those who are inactive in the community, in order to maintain a greater level of checks and balances with regards to capital deployment.",,,,,,

@meridian (Sam Bacha) What gives you such assurance?  As I said, I'm basing this solely on what I can see from public platforms (Discourse, Discord, Telegram, Twitter, Github).  Unless interactions with other contributors is in private or invite-only groups, it appears to me that several of the current signers are not actively engaged in Yearn.  Don't get me wrong, I have utmost respect for all of the signers, as they're some of the most active and well-regarded people in the space.  I'm just questioning if many of them are still currently active with Yearn, as on the surface, many do not appear to be.  What sources are you referencing that lead you to believe that all 9 current signers are active in Yearn?",,,,,,

@banteg Ok, thanks for the insight.  That's a lot of groups!  So I guess where my misunderstanding lied is in the delegation of responsibility of spending decision-making to the Ops Team.  They essentially make these spending decisions and then, in order for those decisions to be executed, they need to go through the MultiSig.

""A Yearn Contributor may derive profits from developing Yearn Technologies without any need or related incentive to own YFI. A developer will be incentivized to create new Strategies because, if the Strategies are accepted by vote of the YFI holders for implementation into a Vault, the developer will receive 10% of the resulting Harvesting Fees (see above). Thus, a talented developer can harness the huge pool of capital available in the Yearn vaults for his own personal profit, without caring at all whether this benefits YFI holders as such. By contrast, the typical token economy associated with other DeFi systems is more strongly designed to drive surplus system fees to the governance token...""",,,,,,

But for something lower yield like a yDAI vault, or stablecoin vaults, I view it more like an ETF or robo advisor mutual fund, where a 0.5% mgmt fee is more common.  (0.5/10 might make more sense here)

The devs do the bulk (if not all) of the work, but unfortunately have very little governance power.  It would be like every country in the world agreeing to be governed by a vote but the US and China each get 1 vote and Suriname gets 10,000 votes.  It really doesn't matter what your proposals are because the appropriate stakeholders don't have a say in what you want to establish.  I feel like every time there is a vote the dev's are holding their breath and saying to themselves 'guys don't f*ck this up.' because they have very little say in the outcome.  Before we establish any formal governance procedures we should correct this disconnect otherwise its just dictating terms to those who don't have a voice yet hold enormous power in the system.  We should probably be required to delegate 25-40% of a token's voting power to a dev controlled multi-sig or mint some YFI tokens (before burning the keys) with a vesting schedule and give to a dev controlled multi-sig.  Only at that point can we have a real conversation about long term governance.  Until then its just YFI holders recognizing this power imbalance and implicitly giving  dev led proposals greater weight of passing (ie: if I have 100 YFI tokens, 25-40 should be an automatic yes vote on things the devs want an I have discretion on the other 60-75).",,,,,,

At that point, it has to be clear what the money is used for in 21 and beyond & I'd recommend inviting large holders like Polychain to discuss this beforehand and get their official support.

- Small retail investors are not discouraged by the huge price
- Clear Roadmap, investor confidence, making it easier to join & support

- Onboard dev talent for the long-term

Can we finally put the whole ""YFI is a valueless gov token"" BS CYA party line to bed now? Never did have much credibility, but now that there is a huge push to mint said valueless token and stash ~$100M into the treasury...hopefully no one keeps trying to continue the ""valueless"" charade any longer, just to avoid potential sanctioning...actions speak much louder and claiming ""valueless"" while profiting won't shield anyone. 
Further...this whole ""devs provide value vs holders don't"" argument and mint vs no mint debate has been fascinating to observe.  Suppose we'd need to define value. The idea that those holding a token as nothing more than a show of project support, investment or seeking passive income are of no value couldn't be more misguided. Anyone who understands enterprise and business knows that value takes many forms...and social capital is just as important as fiscal capital to the survival of any startup. And I don't just mean # of followers and sm groups. In traditional markets (yes, we can learn a lot from the last 100 years of traditional finance)...passive shareholders are considered incredibly valuable...most of which simply hold shares (ownership interest) for dividends, income and appreciation. But why? Because they are the bedrock of support for the entire enterprise...they vote, they advocate, they maintain price support, they use and buy product, and provide countless other forms of intangible value.

Let me be clear...a protocol should have as much or as little supply as it needs to meet its intended objectives. CORE has 10k limit, LINK has 1B, ADA has 45B...that's not the issue...the issue is the after the fact reasoning regarding â€œtreasuryâ€?(ie: funds we can mostly do whatever we want with) and that the initial fair launch caused current devs to feel like they don't hold enough YFI.

Gov participation/turnout is incredibly low because voting has a high opportunity cost by losing out on yield from farming. This was the main reason for removing the quorum requirement in YIP-55â€”even for the best, easiest YIPs, it was very difficult to rally enough votes, and dev/team energy can be spent on much better things than begging people to stake their YFI for a vote they all agree with.

My understanding: Yearn is getting this new EPS via an airdrop, but if Yearn just sells it and forces downward pressure on its price, Ellipsis will exclude Yearn from future airdrops cause they will see them as a ""bad actor."" This is requesting a formalization on how to handle this and future air drops of this nature?",,,,,,
1.60827E+17,waffleophagus,2021/4/5 ä¸‹åˆ2:19,2021/4/5 ,"The question I guess I have, is does this outline what that formalization is? Or is it going to be on a case by case basis (it appears to be that?) And if it is case by case, who makes that decision/",,,,,,

1.60827E+17,waffleophagus,2021/4/5 ä¸‹åˆ2:24,2021/4/5 ,how will a donation maximize the value of the depositors? Will it be similar to backscratcher? What if there is no backscracher functionality where there is no benefit?,,,,,,

7.60322E+17,HAtTip3675#6478,2021/4/5 ä¸‹åˆ2:28,2021/4/5 ,the donator doesn't get vault shares so the benefit of the contribution is earned proportionally by all actual depositors holding vault tokens,,,,,,
1.60827E+17,waffleophagus,2021/4/5 ä¸‹åˆ2:29,2021/4/5 ,"ok, but in the upcoming cases we're seeing, its not donating dai to the dai vault, but say getting EPS and donating it to the dai vault.",,,,,,
1.60827E+17,waffleophagus,2021/4/5 ä¸‹åˆ2:30,2021/4/5 ,"cause right now, the vault takes the curve tokens it earns, sells it for dia, and donates that (or donates half of that, and half goes to the vault)",,,,,,

7.60322E+17,HAtTip3675#6478,2021/4/5 ä¸‹åˆ2:32,2021/4/5 ,Correct.  That's where yearn has to decide how to accrete the EPS value to the vault.  The goal is that all value from EPS should accrete to the vault its just how to best do that given selling outright is problematic for the reasons you describe,,,,,,
7.60322E+17,HAtTip3675#6478,2021/4/5 ä¸‹åˆ2:32,2021/4/5 ,but the goal is the value should accrete only to the backscrather vault and no where else,,,,,,

Donating is great, but what if we had a smart contract that took a % of the yields we generated from our vaults in addition to any fiat from our regular jobs and allocated it to another vault - where the principal was in custody of the charity but the yield on that principal was what was sent to the charityâ€™s wallet, as they needed it.

Iâ€™m a biz dev over with Syscoin. 

We are steadily deploying our sophisticated 4-Layer modular tech stack, with a sophisticated dual-chain down on L1 where all the security will happen. 
Weâ€™re an OG chain, since â€?4, steadily building out our initial L1 Bitcoin fork and completed that roadmap this time last year.
The other side to this running parallel and in lockstep is our NEVM, practically Ethereumâ€™s EVM with a couple of tweaks. Both of these are merge-mined with Bitcoin, currently we use around 20-22% of BTC entire hashrate and we use chainlocks deployed on our masternode layer (~2400 w/ ~$220m tvl) so we can fully inherit that security. 

We are preparing for zkrollups/zkEVM and expect to have these deployed in the next couple of months. 

On our l1 though, we are just about to roll out our ecosystem with some deployments of our Dex and some other primitives including a household name.

And I want to see if I can help you out in any way. Iâ€™m personally deep into Defi myself and am a Defi content creator.

What Iâ€™ve found out with connecting with many people is that most people are scared of taking the jump from centralized exchanges into the world of defi. And itâ€™s my goal to help change that.

The process of the Governance 2.0 proposal (<https://docs.yearn.finance/contributing/governance/governance-and-operations>) is relatively clear and straightforward but I don't understand how this translates to the YFI ""teams"" (<https://yearnfinance.notion.site/Teams-d73d1731214b4bc1a2095067573b6463>). 

Do these hubs act as yTeams which further delegate their delegated powers to sub teams? Is there public info available about how the exact powers are currently delegated to which sub entities?",,,,,,

1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/6/12 ä¸‹åˆ5:20,2022/6/12,And then multisig acts kinda like a republic where they need to fulfill the social contract of implementing a YIP,,,,,,

ERROR: Cannot install ape_safe because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    eth-brownie 1.18.1 depends on vyper==0.3.1
    eth-brownie 1.18.0 depends on vyper==0.3.1
    eth-brownie 1.17.2 depends on vyper==0.3.1

    eth-brownie 1.17.0 depends on vyper==0.3.0

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict

1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ3:59,2022/9/10,"It only has the power to propose transactions, not sign",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ3:59,2022/9/10,Then you can store that on your computer safely and in an encrypted file,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ3:59,2022/9/10,Brownie has an easy way to set this up,,,,,,
5.85533E+17,commercium.sys,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ3:59,2022/9/10,"what does ""is not one of ."" mean?",,,,,,
5.85533E+17,commercium.sys,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ3:59,2022/9/10,is it supposed to be proposing options to me?,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ3:59,2022/9/10,Yeah it looks locally for signers you have in brownie already added,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ3:59,2022/9/10,But you have none,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:00,2022/9/10,"That's because I didn't mount that file into the container, I'll fix it in a bit",,,,,,
5.85533E+17,commercium.sys,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:00,2022/9/10,you mean this docker container has none,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:00,2022/9/10,Brownie has a keystore file with your signers,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:00,2022/9/10,"Yeah, the container didn't mount that file and copy it so its brownie can see",,,,,,
5.85533E+17,commercium.sys,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:01,2022/9/10,ok cool. how can I be sure of the security of this docker container? nothing personal,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:01,2022/9/10,Lol good question since it is just an image that I uploaded,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:01,2022/9/10,Here's what I'll do,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:01,2022/9/10,I'll just upload the actual dockerfile,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:01,2022/9/10,And then the run script will built it from scratch,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:02,2022/9/10,Instead of downloading it from a repository,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:02,2022/9/10,That way you know exactly what is running in that container,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:02,2022/9/10,I'll fix it up later and let you know,,,,,,
5.85533E+17,commercium.sys,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:02,2022/9/10,great.,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:02,2022/9/10,"I only uploaded it to a repository to make it dead simple but I agree, there is no way for you to guarantee I don't add extra shit to steal your private key",,,,,,
5.85533E+17,commercium.sys,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:02,2022/9/10,"also, I was trying to use brownie with a hardware wallet the other day. the clef stuff wasn't working for me.",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:03,2022/9/10,Ape-safe supports trezor not sure if ledger,,,,,,
5.85533E+17,commercium.sys,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:03,2022/9/10,"yea, I was using ledger.",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:03,2022/9/10,You might just want to use a gnosis delegate with a hot private key tbh,,,,,,

1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:03,2022/9/10,And then you can always just revoke the delegate,,,,,,
5.85533E+17,commercium.sys,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:04,2022/9/10,can you describe that to me? is it the process you were describing above? a delegate that can propose but not confirm,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:04,2022/9/10,Yeah,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:04,2022/9/10,I'll show you how to add a delegate,,,,,,

1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:04,2022/9/10,this is a site that the Badger folks created to make it simple to add a delegate,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:04,2022/9/10,you just connect your wallet and then click add delegate and then paste in the delegate's public address,,,,,,

1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:05,2022/9/10,or you can use these instructions,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:05,2022/9/10,just the part under `Adding a delegate account`,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:06,2022/9/10,"oof, those instructions are kinda old",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:06,2022/9/10,"I recommend using the site, but let me know if you are more comfortable using command line, I can fix up the instructions",,,,,,
5.85533E+17,commercium.sys,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:08,2022/9/10,"tbh I am a bit lost right now, in general",,,,,,
5.85533E+17,commercium.sys,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:09,2022/9/10,"I tried running my brownie tests with whatever I had going on from trying to get ape-safe working, and they failed. so I had to uninstall brownie and reinstall with the latest. i'm walking on eggshells here and brownie seems really touchy to me right now",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:09,2022/9/10,"basically, you probably don't want to store your private key on your computer and also signing with a hardware wallet is annoying",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:09,2022/9/10,"so you can create a delegate account, a new private key",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:10,2022/9/10,"add that as a delegate to your safe. It can only propose transactions, not sign",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:10,2022/9/10,then you are safe to have that stored encrypted on your computer to sign with brownie,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:10,2022/9/10,"and then when you want to queue a transaction, ape-safe will prompt you for the delegate password and you type that in and the the transaction gets sent to the safe",,,,,,
5.85533E+17,commercium.sys,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:10,2022/9/10,"yeah, I get that. I'm just daunted that I will be able to understand what ape-safe is doing. at least right now that feels like the case",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:11,2022/9/10,basically ape-safe is just gathering the transactions you ran in brownie and then sending them to gnosis safe,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:11,2022/9/10,and it needs you to sign the payload with a delegate or signer,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:11,2022/9/10,then the transaction will show up on the gnosis safe website,,,,,,
5.85533E+17,commercium.sys,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:12,2022/9/10,"yeah. how does it send them to gnosis safe? that's through an endpoint  they host, right?",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:14,2022/9/10,yeah,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:14,2022/9/10,it is just an HTTP endpoint,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:14,2022/9/10,a POST request with some signed payload,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:15,2022/9/10,https://github.com/banteg/ape-safe/blob/2aa3c4e888363728010d7e0bb9626077afe077ca/ape_safe.py#L219,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:15,2022/9/10,that is done here,,,,,,
5.85533E+17,commercium.sys,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:15,2022/9/10,"so a gnosis safe is partially off chain then - they hold on to the transactions until everyone signs them, and that payload is invoked on chain, where it can verify n signatures?",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:19,2022/9/10,"yeah, they have a transaction service",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:19,2022/9/10,that stores the transactions and their signatures,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:19,2022/9/10,and they host a backend that stores all this,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:19,2022/9/10,"and when a transaction is fully signed, anyone can execute it",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:20,2022/9/10,since the signed transaction is public information,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:20,2022/9/10,"usually someone won't do that unless it is an MEV bot that is looking to screw you over, that's why yearn will sign and exec using a private RPC like flashbots for sensitive transactions",,,,,,
5.85533E+17,commercium.sys,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:21,2022/9/10,"gotcha.

what about the simulation capabilities of ape-safe? do they basically just tell you if a transaction will revert?",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:21,2022/9/10,like the team won't ever leave a sensitive tx at 3 out of 3 signatures or something,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:21,2022/9/10,"and the 3rd signer needs to sign and exec using a private RPC if the transaction is something that can be sandwiched, like a vault harvest",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:21,2022/9/10,yes,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:21,2022/9/10,it will run it all in the forked network and preview the results before you need to sign,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:22,2022/9/10,"if the TX would fail, then it won't even ask you to sign or send to the safe",,,,,,
5.85533E+17,commercium.sys,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:23,2022/9/10,"yeah. say there are circumstances that change and a transaction will fail, what do you do as the safe owners? do you need to broadcast it just to fail, in order to get the nonces correct?",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:25,2022/9/10,"no, you can just overwrite the nonce",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:26,2022/9/10,"in ape-safe, you can set the nonce value. if you don't specify, it will just use the latest pending nonce and add one",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:26,2022/9/10,but if you have a TX that you think will fail already pending,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:27,2022/9/10,"you can just overwrite the nonce like this:
```
  safe_tx = safe.multisend_from_receipts(safe_nonce=420)
```",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:27,2022/9/10,if you had 420 pending but wanted to overwrite it with something new,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:27,2022/9/10,then just pass in `safe_nonce=420` for your new transaction,,,,,,
5.85533E+17,commercium.sys,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:27,2022/9/10,got it,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:27,2022/9/10,the other option is to broadcast a failure but that is wasting gas money,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:28,2022/9/10,since you have to sign the failure and then exec it on chain,,,,,,
3.41674E+17,pbnather,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:29,2022/9/10,We should have some contributors/developers channel,,,,,,
3.41674E+17,pbnather,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:29,2022/9/10,Many more hacktivists will join yearn soon to contriboooote,,,,,,
5.85533E+17,commercium.sys,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:30,2022/9/10,yea,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:30,2022/9/10,btw I updated the template repo,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:31,2022/9/10,now activate.sh isn't required and also now your signers will show up if you have them locally at ~/.brownie/accounts,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:31,2022/9/10,and also now it will build the Dockerfile locally,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:31,2022/9/10,so you can see in the Dockerfile file exactly what this thing is building,,,,,,
5.85533E+17,commercium.sys,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:31,2022/9/10,"nice, that's great",,,,,,
5.85533E+17,commercium.sys,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:32,2022/9/10,so this repository will help the developer experience of creating the transactions it seems,,,,,,
5.85533E+17,commercium.sys,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:32,2022/9/10,"what about that repo you guys have, where you just push to it, and it broadcasts the transaction to a safe - that's something you were talking about right?",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:33,2022/9/10,"yeah, that is called robowoofy and something that I built",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:33,2022/9/10,it uses ape-safe internally,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:34,2022/9/10,"there is a public way to fork it:
https://github.com/yearn/yearn-multisig-actions

But the instructions aren't up-to-date, I need to refresh them a little. You can still try to set it up though",,,,,,
5.85533E+17,commercium.sys,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:34,2022/9/10,"what's the benefit of doing that? I guess it brings a process to submitting the transactions. so you can do a pull request, and get reviewers, before a transaction is submitted to the safe?",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:34,2022/9/10,this is a good way to coordinate on transactions if you want to have someone review the code,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:35,2022/9/10,,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/734805853768777738/1018258368957259796/unknown.png,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:35,2022/9/10,the benefit is that people can read the code and see exactly what was ran to make the transaction,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:35,2022/9/10,and it alerts people there is a new transaction to sign,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:35,2022/9/10,"and yes, you can require reviewers too",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:36,2022/9/10,which is what we do for the main yearn multisig,,,,,,
5.85533E+17,commercium.sys,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:36,2022/9/10,"yeah, so it formalizes the process. gotcha. and this uses a hot private key with proposal permissions and not signer permissions",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:36,2022/9/10,"yeah, it is a hot private key and it is also stored on either github runners or your own VMs if you self-host",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:37,2022/9/10,well actually either way it is stored in github secrets so you need to trust github a bit,,,,,,
5.85533E+17,commercium.sys,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:37,2022/9/10,"so there's a few multisigs that you guys use, right? what about the emergency shutdown multisig, that only has two required signatures right? how does yearn manage that - because they might need to act quickly in an emergency.",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:37,2022/9/10,"but it is also just a delegate private key, so not the biggest risk",,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:37,2022/9/10,yearn has so many multisigs,,,,,,

7.43221E+17,arberx,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:37,2022/9/10,and send it to me instead,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:38,2022/9/10,for every chain we have a strategist multisig and a chad multisig,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:38,2022/9/10,we also have a multisig for other shit like keepers,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:38,2022/9/10,and also for something called ytrades,,,,,,
1.3951E+17,kx9x,2022/9/10 ä¸‹åˆ4:38,2022/9/10,"for emergency shutdown, I thought that is just ychad, which is 6 of 9 signers",,,,,,

What do people think about a partially anonymous forum? Has anyone censored their controversial ideas due to fear of social reprisals? What have you done if your idea goes against the big players in the DAO? Can partial anonymity be a way to start addressing group think?

I understand that social reputation is important in qualifying the ideas but, it also gets in the way of viewing ideas based on its merits. In certain cases, we censor our controversial comments because it goes against the grain of the majority of DAOs and we tend to not point that out because of fear of social reprisal. Again, this may get in the way of having the most effective decision as some ideas are not considered (and that â€œconsensusâ€?is a more of a capitulation than general agreement that we have the best idea.)

I believe that certain topics may require an anon space to assess the ideas by its merits rather than rely too heavily on the social representation (albeit it has an important role in the DAO). 

How do you think anon forums would impact the quality of forum discussions?",,,,,,

4.90971E+17,hipsterman,2022/12/2 ä¸Šåˆ3:57,2022/12/2,"Hi All, 
I've put together the following formal request to Activate veYFI and would greatly appreciate anyone's thoughts or feedback. 
While this request is not necessary for veYFI to be Activated (see below), it is prudent we maintain Yearn's ideals to continue to foster effective decentralized collaboration among this awesome, leaderless network. Therefore, if the date and time of Activation has not yet been established, and if all of the contributors have completed their implementation work, then we are to take it upon ourselves, as the voices of Yearn, to set the veYFI Activation date & time. 

**Request to Activate veYFI**
Objective: Formally request to establish a date and time to Activate veYFI.
**Background**: veYFIâ€™s implementation timeline is at the discretion of the contributors doing the implementation work. Contract appears to be completed and ready for Activation. Activation date and time has not yet been made public.
**Acknowledgment**:
Thank you - all who have contributed - for all of your hard work in Yearn and on veYFI and itâ€™s integration(s).

To Those Contributors, we ask,
Can we please publicly set a time and date to Activate veYFI?

The following suggestions were provided:
**Option 1: IMMEDIATELY PLEASE ACTIVATE ASAP AHHH**
â€?   Thoughts: Would be ideal to maybe have a public-facing countdown timer and/or a 24hr heads-up so we canâ€¦prepare.

**Option 2: Relevant Anniversary Dates:**
veYFIâ€™s YIP 65 was introduced on Dec. 18, 2021, and finalized on Dec. 30, 2021.
â€?   Thoughts: Either of those dates may prove viable. Dec. 18 may allow us to catch a greater audience if implemented before the holidays. Post-Dec. 30th could potentially yield lesser attention as the focus is on the holidays, families, and the implementation of New Yearâ€™s goals (less spending, investing, etcâ€?. Thereforeâ€?if not implemented sooner per Option 1)â€?**Formal Request for veYFI Activation:**

Does anyone have resources on how Guardian would be set up and methods for alerting etc. when it comes to pausing the protocol? I'd like to find out methods on optimizing that type of system, especially when it comes to the speed/efficiency of the process for something changing -> alert owner addresses -> protocol pauses",,,,,,
