@infinitystreams 
I would begin with making sure that you've planned out the idea for your DAO meticulously and ensure the actual day to day operations are running smoothly and you have ""gotten the ball rolling"" so to say. 

Once youve done that you will have something to start creating a community around. Then, once youve started gaining traction with your community, i would create the DAO. 

Theres no need to create a DAO (spending the money on gas, learning the App, etc.) Until these other things are in place. 

I was speaking with another community manager and we agreed that one of the biggest challenges people face when starting a DAO is skipping steps. They will start a DAO before they have people to actually participate in that DAO and then wonder why its not gaining traction. Definitely dont want this happening to you!",,üî• (3),,,

I am an Organizational Psychologist, with experience with Web2 Enterprise Risk Management, and am keen on helping improve DAO risk management with, for example, psychometrics.  In traditional firms, there are dashboards that track various operational risks related to products, services and customers; as well as contextual risks around finance, and HR.  The types of risks from leaders and DAO members is where my strength lies (e.g. detect and mitigate risk in DAO members and teams).  In reading the resources Carla and Incandenza shared, I don't see these sorts of operational dashboards.  I have a vision for how these might be useful to compliment all Aragon DAOs in reducing risks, but don't want to ""reinvent the wheel"" if there are other resources I should learn about first?

I am representing a project initiative planning to start a DAO combining all values of Ethereum to its capacity. 

Here is the rough overview of the project plan

Rough overview & TLDR

Wild Sherpas is a sustainable tourism business that provides camping experiences in the midst of lush green forests and is surrounded by prominent mountains. The main mission is to promote eco-tourism and educate guests about the fragility of receding Biodiversity and conservation. While providing a unique and memorable experience for the guests. We understand the Ethos, Values & Philosophy of this space & and we are taking our first step with a humble beginning. We have seen numerous experiments and then there are Hype-based extraction funnels with no legit value added to the ecosystem. Our project aims to be in alignment with the Values that CypherPunks upheld and fought for. We are thinking of this project as an intersection of Nature, Culture, Art and Crypto in a meaningful way.

https://www.instagram.com/wildsherpas/

Basic idea is to launch a yield-generating NFT project that will be the Universal Membership pass, we are combining DeFi elements with Art, Nature & the most important ""Social Layer"" (We are in contact with some famous Artists & Artwork from a blend of Artists from every continent)",,,,,
8.36394E+17,maxzenith,2023/2/16 ‰∏äÂçà5:19,2023/2/16,"NFT Mechanism (Initial draft TLDR)

Two Tiers of NFTs

-* Tier 1 (~25$)*

‚Ä?1 NFT represents a redeemable voucher for a single stay (with 2 meals and one short guided trek).
‚Ä?Each NFT mint will plant a tree.
‚Ä?5% of royalties will go to Gitcoin 
‚Ä?% dedicated to a Cultural fund to support deserving Artists
‚Ä?Art & Craft Exhibitions for holders Artists (free of cost)
‚Ä?Holders can conduct Crypto meetups at the property (Free Entry for their community, PS: Pay for stay & Food for folks who want to stay the night)
‚Ä? Other utilities & perks 

- *Tier 2 (~500-700$)*

Holders will have 
‚Ä?% of Royalties from tier 1 NFT trades
‚Ä?% of Royalties from Tier 2 NFT trades
‚Ä?10 Trees üå≤to be planted per NFT mint
‚Ä?% of royalties to Gitcoin
‚Ä?% of the amount raised to support DAOs focused on (Free speech, ETH core Devs, Climate & Sustainability)
‚Ä?Redeemable for stay with food (Free of cost for 30 days max)
‚Ä?Retroactive Rewards distribution to holders from Ecosystem Partners 
‚Ä?All utilities of Tier 1 to be included
‚Ä?Wild Sherpas are fully operational with all the Infrastructure and without any financial Liabilities. We are planning to distribute its Profit % to Tier 2 NFT holders [Constant streaming or monthly distribution (ERC20)], making those NFTs yield-bearing tokens.

Ethos Initiatives
- Wild Sherpas will run Ethereum & Gnosis Nodes, accept crypto payments, and a Dex widget on the website with Onramp/Offramp integration.


*Future plans* (Immediate steps for Roadmap)

- Build Remote workers' hub with key infrastructure for the home office hybrid. (Profit % generated will go to Tier 2 NFT holders)
- Fund educational expenses for Tribal children.
- Waste management initiative (bins and collection service to recycling plants)
- EV charging Stations + food trucks (Right now we have only one EV charging station in the region)
- Support Women empowerment initiatives (DAOs, Underprivileged and economically backward)",,,,,

Re your question: I think the Aragon app is definitely suitable. We are on Polygon and you can store any of your evm compatible digital assets in an Aragon DAO. I'm not sure exactly what you mean by ""Offchain investments"" but, from what i'm getting here, anything happening offchain would essentially be a signaling vote that would need to be executed by a human agent.

Any thoughts?

I considered minting the full amount of tokens to a token supply wallet and allowing any Ethereum address to create a proposal in the DAO.

The token supply wallet would drop tokens into the DAO Treasury.

When someone wants to join, they would send ETH to the DAO Treasury and request tokens in the same proposal.  If the exchange rate is correct, the proposal would be passed by the token supply wallet (it would have the ability to pass or block any proposal by virtue of it's voting power until the tokens are fully distributed).",,,,,

Native turns ‚Äúexchange‚Ä?into a feature so any app can deploy their own swap in minutes.

Using Native, projects earn all their own swap fees. Depending on volume, fee revenue can be upwards of 6-7 figures / month, straight to the project treasury.

Native also has integrations with professional market-makers (PMMs) which are normally only available to CEXs. This makes it super easy (and free) for a project to go live with a tier 1 liquidity provider on chain. Using Native is a way to get deep liquidity and high capital efficiency on-chain without losing revenue through emissions or incentives.

At the end of the day, Native is about helping projects get more liquidity and earn more revenue. Let me know if you would like to further discuss how we can help you increase revenue while creating a seamless experience for your users.

Thank you‚úåüè?,"",""

I have a following problem - on Goerli, I have tried to call `createPluginRepoWithFirstVersion` for deployed contract (everything taken from docs tutorial).

If I try to publish my plugin with Etherscan I got `Internal JSON-RPC error`, so I have decided to use the script from the docs, but then I struggle with some incompatibility of `Signer | Provider` for `.connect` function.


```import {
  PluginRepoFactory__factory,
  PluginRepoRegistry__factory,
  PluginRepo__factory,
} from ""@aragon/osx-ethers"";
import { ethers } from ""ethers"";
import { DeployFunction } from ""hardhat-deploy/types"";
import { HardhatRuntimeEnvironment } from ""hardhat/types"";

const func: DeployFunction = async function (hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment) {
  const { deployments, network } = hre;
  const deployer = (await hre.ethers.getSigners())[0] as ethers.Signer;

  const deployerAddress = await deployer.getAddress();

  console.log(""test1"");

  const provider = deployer.provider;
  if (!provider) {
    throw new Error(""No provider found"");
  }
  const pluginRepoFactoryAddr = ""0x301868712b77744A3C0E5511609238399f0A2d4d"";

  console.log(""test2"");

  const pluginRepoFactory = PluginRepoFactory__factory.connect(
    pluginRepoFactoryAddr,
    provider
  );

  console.log(""test3"");
...

  console.log(
    `You can find the transaction address which published the ${pluginName} Plugin here: ${tx}`
  );
};

export default func;```

I cannot see any logs when I run script with npx hardhat. Any tips?","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1036975360551702568/1121799612391510066/console-log.png,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1036975360551702568/1121799612735426620/error.png",,,,

Before starting [@RnDAO__](https://twitter.com/RnDAO__), we saw many talented teams waste countless hours on ideas that had already been tried or don't solve a problem for anyone. We spent the next 18 months developing a methodology to help web3 entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs (developing 6 ventures in the process) and now want to share it with others.
We created a (free) mini-accelerator. It's 2 sessions of 2 hours, on the week of the 3rd of July, and we would love you to help us invite as many people as possible who are in the early stage of building a product, looking for product-market fit, or haven't yet started. Together we can move web3 and DAOs forward.

this is the scehma for ERC721Transfer_orderBy it has two fields with the following names: ""token__id"" and ""tokenId""

the graphql codegen translates this into:

export enum Erc721Transfer_OrderBy {

  TokenId = 'token__id', // tsc: Duplicated identifier TokenId

- The DAO manages permissions and plugins listen to the DAO's permission database.
- Permissions determine whether a function can be called by someone or not. 
- Plugins can pass proposals to add/remove permissions on the DAO.

But if what you want is a way to prevent ERC20 deposits to a DAO, then this is a completely separate topic, which has no solution. Nothing prevents me from sending 10 DAI to you, as the transfer happens elsewhere (the token contract) and the token contract won't notify the recipient. You could notice the transaction and sent the money back after the fact, but that's how the standard works.

The deposit function is meant for NFT's, because in this case, the standard requires the token contract to notify the receiver (if possible). For such cases the DAO could register a default callback handler and revert if applicable. If I recall correctly these can only be methods within the DAO contract, not external plugin methods.

Identity is a challenging problem. In your community you could ask people to use existing solutions (e.g., BrightID, PoH, Sismo.io) for the address on which they want to receive delegations.
Alternatively, you could curate a registry of authentic members that are allowed to vote in your DAO but this is on the cost of permissionlessness, of course.

1. Created a new DAO in App and selected the existing DAO's token (originally created in Client) to be wrapped by holders.
2. Wrapping is throwing an error code for holders (not the most pressing issue though).
3. Went back and read through more material and saw that no new tokens can be minted from App, only minted externally and wrapped in App.
4. Client won't load Finance or Vote apps so we can't vote on minting new tokens to be wrapped or transfer treasury funds to App. 

My conclusion: If Client was working, I could solve all of our issues with a series of steps. But with Client being deprecated and no longer receiving updates from the Aragon team, we will have to look elsewhere (I'm guessing that means hiring a dev?) that allows our DAO to vote on mints and treasury moves. Is this correct?",,,,,

As far as other L2's, we are keeping an eye on community sentiment to see what other chains to support next. I'll note that you asked about arbitrum!

You can launch on eth, pol, or base here: https://app.aragon.org/",,,,,

Q2: When you're operating your DAO from the Aragon App you don't interact with the smart contracts directly. Do you mean when changing your governance settings? Or are you referring to building a DAO directly with the SDK/Aragon OSx?",,,,,
