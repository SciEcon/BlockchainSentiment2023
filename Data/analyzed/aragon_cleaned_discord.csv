@infinitystreams 
I would begin with making sure that you've planned out the idea for your DAO meticulously and ensure the actual day to day operations are running smoothly and you have ""gotten the ball rolling"" so to say. 

Once youve done that you will have something to start creating a community around. Then, once youve started gaining traction with your community, i would create the DAO. 

Theres no need to create a DAO (spending the money on gas, learning the App, etc.) Until these other things are in place. 

I was speaking with another community manager and we agreed that one of the biggest challenges people face when starting a DAO is skipping steps. They will start a DAO before they have people to actually participate in that DAO and then wonder why its not gaining traction. Definitely dont want this happening to you!",,ð¥ (3),yup thanks incandenza utc infinitystreams would begin making sure youve planned idea dao meticulously ensure actual day day operations running smoothly gotten ball rolling say youve done something start creating community around youve started gaining traction community would create dao theres need create dao spending money gas learning app etc things place speaking another community manager agreed one biggest challenges people face starting dao skipping steps start dao people actually participate dao wonder gaining traction definitely dont want happening

Rough overview & TLDR

Wild Sherpas is a sustainable tourism business that provides camping experiences in the midst of lush green forests and is surrounded by prominent mountains. The main mission is to promote eco-tourism and educate guests about the fragility of receding Biodiversity and conservation. While providing a unique and memorable experience for the guests. We understand the Ethos, Values & Philosophy of this space & and we are taking our first step with a humble beginning. We have seen numerous experiments and then there are Hype-based extraction funnels with no legit value added to the ecosystem. Our project aims to be in alignment with the Values that CypherPunks upheld and fought for. We are thinking of this project as an intersection of Nature, Culture, Art and Crypto in a meaningful way.

â?5% of royalties will go to Gitcoin 
â?% dedicated to a Cultural fund to support deserving Artists
â?Art & Craft Exhibitions for holders Artists (free of cost)
â?Holders can conduct Crypto meetups at the property (Free Entry for their community, PS: Pay for stay & Food for folks who want to stay the night)

Ethos Initiatives
- Wild Sherpas will run Ethereum & Gnosis Nodes, accept crypto payments, and a Dex widget on the website with Onramp/Offramp integration.


*Future plans* (Immediate steps for Roadmap)

- Build Remote workers' hub with key infrastructure for the home office hybrid. (Profit % generated will go to Tier 2 NFT holders)

Any thoughts?

I considered minting the full amount of tokens to a token supply wallet and allowing any Ethereum address to create a proposal in the DAO.

The token supply wallet would drop tokens into the DAO Treasury.

When someone wants to join, they would send ETH to the DAO Treasury and request tokens in the same proposal.  If the exchange rate is correct, the proposal would be passed by the token supply wallet (it would have the ability to pass or block any proposal by virtue of it's voting power until the tokens are fully distributed).",,,thinking token distribution method dao powered aragon thoughts considered minting full amount tokens token supply wallet allowing ethereum address create proposal dao token supply wallet would drop tokens dao treasury someone wants join would send eth dao treasury request tokens proposal exchange rate correct proposal would passed token supply wallet would ability pass block proposal virtue voting power tokens fully distributed

Native turns âexchangeâ?into a feature so any app can deploy their own swap in minutes.

Using Native, projects earn all their own swap fees. Depending on volume, fee revenue can be upwards of 6-7 figures / month, straight to the project treasury.

Native also has integrations with professional market-makers (PMMs) which are normally only available to CEXs. This makes it super easy (and free) for a project to go live with a tier 1 liquidity provider on chain. Using Native is a way to get deep liquidity and high capital efficiency on-chain without losing revenue through emissions or incentives.

At the end of the day, Native is about helping projects get more liquidity and earn more revenue. Let me know if you would like to further discuss how we can help you increase revenue while creating a seamless experience for your users.

Thank youâð?,"",""

I have a following problem - on Goerli, I have tried to call `createPluginRepoWithFirstVersion` for deployed contract (everything taken from docs tutorial).

If I try to publish my plugin with Etherscan I got `Internal JSON-RPC error`, so I have decided to use the script from the docs, but then I struggle with some incompatibility of `Signer | Provider` for `.connect` function.


```import {
  PluginRepoFactory__factory,
  PluginRepoRegistry__factory,
  PluginRepo__factory,
} from ""@aragon/osx-ethers"";
import { ethers } from ""ethers"";
import { DeployFunction } from ""hardhat-deploy/types"";
import { HardhatRuntimeEnvironment } from ""hardhat/types"";

const func: DeployFunction = async function (hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment) {
  const { deployments, network } = hre;
  const deployer = (await hre.ethers.getSigners())[0] as ethers.Signer;

  const deployerAddress = await deployer.getAddress();

  console.log(""test1"");

  const provider = deployer.provider;
  if (!provider) {
    throw new Error(""No provider found"");
  }
  const pluginRepoFactoryAddr = ""0x301868712b77744A3C0E5511609238399f0A2d4d"";

  console.log(""test2"");

  const pluginRepoFactory = PluginRepoFactory__factory.connect(
    pluginRepoFactoryAddr,
    provider
  );

  console.log(""test3"");
...

  console.log(
    `You can find the transaction address which published the ${pluginName} Plugin here: ${tx}`
  );
};

export default func;```

I cannot see any logs when I run script with npx hardhat.

Before starting [@RnDAO__](https://twitter.com/RnDAO__), we saw many talented teams waste countless hours on ideas that had already been tried or don't solve a problem for anyone. We spent the next 18 months developing a methodology to help web3 entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs (developing 6 ventures in the process) and now want to share it with others.
We created a (free) mini-accelerator. It's 2 sessions of 2 hours, on the week of the 3rd of July, and we would love you to help us invite as many people as possible who are in the early stage of building a product, looking for product-market fit, or haven't yet started. Together we can move web3 and DAOs forward.
