@Wizard88  I also think chances are low, it may be ""tough luck"". But the rationale is that it is likely you were trading UNI in early volatile times and it was part of your implicit  risk (tactics). That the essence of the airdrop was for Uniswap to become more decentralized and for that,  new coiners were targeted  to understand its value and those targeted newcoiners would have all clicked on UNI gift link, and interacted by the Dapp contract (buy, sell, claim) , and hence probably exempt from making this error since they would not have had any need to interact with the contract at a lower level.",,,chances proposal allow reallocation tokens people accidentally sent uni tokens uni swap smart contract address accidentally copy paste error gutted wizard also think chances low may tough luck rationale likely trading uni early volatile times part implicit risk tactics essence airdrop uniswap become decentralized new coiners targeted understand value targeted newcoiners would clicked uni gift link interacted dapp contract buy sell claim hence probably exempt making error since would need interact contract lower level

@mmoossttaaffaa 
I think the equitable argument in terms of result misses the point of the argument on hand, at least how I see it. The announcement made a distinction between ""users"" and ""addresses"" in who gets the distribution. Then it added ""addresses that attempted to interact with the contracts but failed"". Addresses aren't necessarily one-to-one in terms of natural person to address but it's at least pretty well understood that ""users"" use and for Uniswap, using it is a process that either adds liquidity, removes liquidity, or makes a swap (in simple terms).

# MVP for Applications and UNI Governance Partnership

An application MUST provide an easy access to:

# A Link to the [Uniswap Governance](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote) page through the primary portal, or view that the end user interacts with.

Verbiage SHOULD be copied from the UNI Governance page as such in the interface for the applcation:

[Uniswap Governance](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote)

UNI tokens represent voting shares in Uniswap Governance. You can vote on each proposal yourself or delegate your votes to a third party.
[Read more about Uniswap Governance](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/)

# Exceptions

* If the application does not support browser transactions and web3, the functionality for web3 support MUST be implemented so that UNI in the user's wallet can be;

1. Self Delegated, or
2. Delegated to an Ethereum Address or ENS name.

* The application MUST provide an ability to visibly confirm which address, the user has delegated to. If the user is self delgated, this should be emphasized if the the users wallet address is not easily viewed when checking the UNI balance.

* The application MUST provide an ability to view current UNI Governance proposals, and whether they have been passed or not.

* The application MUST provide an ability to vote current UNI Governance proposals, and notify the user when the voting is ended.

* For transactions that end in the user holding UNI, an alert to Self Delegate OR Delegate to an Ethereum Address OR ENS Name MUST be raised and require a user to actively DECLINE delegation.

* Any view of the user wallet MUST show that UNI tokens are either delegated, or provide a link to begin the delegation workflow.",,,brendandharma donyakka mvp applications uni governance partnership application must provide easy access link uniswap governance page primary portal view end user interacts verbiage copied uni governance page interface applcation uniswap governance uni tokens represent voting shares uniswap governance vote proposal delegate votes third party read uniswap governance exceptions application support browser transactions web functionality web support must implemented uni users wallet self delegated delegated ethereum address ens name application must provide ability visibly confirm address user delegated user self delgated emphasized users wallet address easily viewed checking uni balance application must provide ability view current uni governance proposals whether passed application must provide ability vote current uni governance proposals notify user voting ended transactions end user holding uni alert self delegate delegate ethereum address ens name must raised require user actively decline delegation view user wallet must show uni tokens either delegated provide link begin delegation workflow

Univalent amassed 10m votes with the express purpose of lowering the voting thresholds. While we wouldn't have pursued that on our own, Univalent made clear that they would not vote for any other proposals. So that was 10m votes that were not available for our proposal. And there were only 47m UNI delegated at all, which made our proposal impossible to pass without Univalent.

Then we got frustrated with Univalent because even though they had the votes to make the proposal, as well as the vocal support of us and other delegations, they were dragging their feet in submitting the formal proposal. So we submitted exactly the proposal that they wanted, in the hope that after proposal, whether passed or not, Univalent would dissolve and their 10m votes would become available to use for other proposals.",,,working proposal since day uni released worked round clock several stakeholders pull together viable proposal univalent amassed votes express purpose lowering voting thresholds wouldnt pursued univalent made clear would vote proposals votes available proposal uni delegated made proposal impossible pass without univalent got frustrated univalent even though votes make proposal well vocal support us delegations dragging feet submitting formal proposal submitted exactly proposal wanted hope proposal whether passed univalent would dissolve votes would become available use proposals

@Chris Blec Hmm, I think there is nuance to this. 

First off, ""decentralizing"", IMO, is the movement towards less concentration of power. Moving from 1 decision maker to 2-of-3 vote would be ""decentralizing"". IMO, ""decentralizing"" does not intrinsically mean ""put power in the hands of users"". 

Secondly, the initial UNI distribution did a lot to decentralize Uniswap's governance, and UNI inflation will continue to increase decentralization.

Finally, whether you like it or not, investors and team members hold tokens right now. It's hard for me to understand the logic by which delegating their votes to Dharma is not an increase in decentralization",,,brendandharma whole idea decentralizing governance take hands company put hands users chris blec hmm think nuance first decentralizing imo movement towards less concentration power moving decision maker vote would decentralizing imo decentralizing intrinsically mean put power hands users secondly initial uni distribution lot decentralize uniswaps governance uni inflation continue increase decentralization finally whether like investors team members hold tokens right hard understand logic delegating votes dharma increase decentralization

760645754682998796,ifunoinsideuyield#5766,10/25/2020 9:13 AM,"Right now, a decent percentage of the LP's are not LP'ing directly with Uniswap, but instead with external farming projects. All they're doing is farming UNI, dumping immediately to cause nonstop-built in sell pressure, and then pumping up the price of their external farm project token to dump and rugpull on the newbs. 

By enabling a new UNI pool and allowing LP's to vote where large uni whales are already involved with the external farm projects to potentially farm a larger percentage of the UNI rewards, it could potentially make the price dumping even more severe and it would allow them to vote in favor of more dumping to favor short term gains over the long term goals of UNI.

@Po there is a difference between price action and token model. A token is designed to align the interest of the actors that make up a community. Self-interest/greed is not a bad thing, when it is aligned with the self-interests of the other actors that make up a community or network. You want to say it's okay for investors to subsidize farmers and other actors. But so far in crypto, the largest set of actors in any projects are hodlers. It's one thing if the price action is down for market reason, but this is not the case. The token model is punishing holders and rewarding farmers that dump on hodlers.

I sincerely hope that UNI governance does not vote for a buyback&burn model when the 0.05% fee is implemented. I think you shouldn't even have an opinion on the topic unless you've read and internalised the above blog post. 

I think simply ""stablecoins as dividends"" works really well in the long run, and I think Curve chose the right path regarding this. This way people get the cash flow from owning CRV (by locking to veCRV), but they freely choose what to do with that cash flow, whether the compound it back to more veCRV, or to do something else.

Buyback&burn first forces you to accept that more UNI is bought with the 0.05% cash flow, and then it would be simply burnt. It can hurt the long-term capitalisation and growth of Uniswap as proposed in the blog post, if done this way. 

I'm surprised that the tentative consensus in the Uniswap community seems to be towards a buyback&burn model. It would be a mistake in my opinion.

> @Micah A few points, I don't think the discussion surround the fee switch should be dictated by which of the two paths are taxable events and which aren't, but instead which incentivizes holding onto UNI and better rewards active participants.  Following the second line, I would argue that a Synthetix style staking mechanism that distributes trading fees is way better at encouraging holding UNI than a burn mechanism. Using BNB as an example there was a ton of analysis done a year ago about how the Burn was a tradable event, people buying before and selling. We can argue the nuances about how BNB doesn't buy on the open market leading to a buyer of last resort, but that still doesn't change my point of it not incentivizing holding the token.

1. 0.05% goes proportionally from all markets to token holders as assets they can claim
2. 0.05% goes to Vault and Uniswap becomes not only DEX but DEF as well (some sort of decentralized fund)

@Tritium agree with your sentiment here. It's great that we're all so passionate about Uniswap but we need to accept that thousands of people having an equally valid voice and opinion is going to create enormous gridlock.

I imagine over time people will begin to just establish their own mental model of a ""board of directors"". Voices will begin to quiet and the more dedicated and trusted members come forward.

But this could take months and would be passive.

1. allows the delegatee to vote on behalf of the delegator (as it is currently)
2. allows the delagatee to discuss decisions with other top delegated members in an open channel which is then put back to vote

@OatMan Don't know exactly what @allÃ´ meant but if I may: it could be accomplished by something akin to YFI where there is a treasury of sorts; the protocol overtime builds a reserve or pool of liquidity it controls so UNI holders control and utilize that reserve

Uniswap 3 will be able to run independantly from governance
Governance still controls treasury, still has the same mandate to help uniswap grow.
Tbh it's a good thing Uniswap will continue to run independantly from governance b/c right now governance does almost nothing. the only proposals we had were for a shady retroactive airdrop ( I say this, and I would have received 800 from the first phase of this airdrop if it had been voted). the dev team really **can't** count on governance. the big delegates are just sitting there, doing basically sweet nuthin'. or at least, it's starting to look like it very much.
Also, the purpose of UNI is to get access to fees eventually. But it's only going to be worth it if Uni grows a lot more IMO. Incentives campaigns can help a protocol grow, as you know.

Uniswap has the potential to steal a lot (more) marketshare from CEXes, so I'm pretty sure there are some forces at work behind the scenes. There is a chance that it could explain why governance (= very much controlled by big delegates) has been so stale/uninteresting for now. (Except the nice discussions we have on the governance forum of course). So, to wrap this up, it's a very good thing that Uniswap 3 continues to runs independantly from governance, because it could stay in a deadlock for a long time. That being said, with more active big delegates, governance could also be an asset to the protocol, instead of a deadweight.

PS another reason why big delegates seem to be asleep at the wheel right now could also be that V3 is imminent and they have been told to wait for the release/announcement. Just another guess. We can't really know.",,,uniswap run wo governance course coded governance uniswap able run independantly governance governance still controls treasury still mandate help uniswap grow tbh good thing uniswap continue run independantly governance bc right governance almost nothing proposals shady retroactive airdrop say would received first phase airdrop voted dev team really cant count governance big delegates sitting basically sweet nuthin least starting look like much also purpose uni get access fees eventually going worth uni grows lot imo incentives campaigns help protocol grow know uniswap potential steal lot marketshare cexes im pretty sure forces work behind scenes chance could explain governance much controlled big delegates staleuninteresting except nice discussions governance forum course wrap good thing uniswap continues runs independantly governance could stay deadlock long time said active big delegates governance could also asset protocol instead deadweight ps another reason big delegates seem asleep wheel right could also v imminent told wait releaseannouncement another guess cant really know

Because for uniswap to access this it would require to read a previous TX which is completely forbidden by ETH's model (allowing lighter clients to delete old state of the blockchain and only remember the current state and the 1000 or so blocks (prunning))

> Using historical tx to assert that some ERC20 were received in contract but no subsequent outgoing tokens, it should be logically possible

183309006767521792,jorropo,03/03/2021 11:31 PM,"@research_omega BTW for sake of completeness if somehow you would implement this there would be 2 ways to implement this (the good and the bad one).

You could use the ERC20Receiver interface on uniswap (having a function called when an ERC20 transfer has occur) that would assert failure.
And having all ERC20 tokens support Receiver (checking does the destination implements ERC20Receiver and if so call onERC20Received). (like http://erc721.org/ does).

And an other solution would be for all ERC20 to store all the TX somewhat (saving the history in state) and allowing uniswap to read it, then uniswap would be able to see who sent him some coins. (would be very complicated an expensive and thus **bad**).

The main problem is that way too many ERC20 tokens doesn't support ERC20Receiver (which is one of the thing 721 fixes).
The problem of starting to use ERC20Receiver today is that there is very little insentives to do so:
- This is somewhat complex to implement
- Very few receivers contract exists and would take advantage of it.
- Very few tokens support forwarding so writting an ERC20Receiver would be almost useless (as almost no tokens support it).

But I still think there is value in starting to use it. We are in an egg chiken problem and starting to use it, as an optional feature (as lack of better option) might drive his usage up in the future.",,,researchomega btw sake completeness somehow would implement would ways implement good bad one could use ercreceiver interface uniswap function called erc transfer occur would assert failure erc tokens support receiver checking destination implements ercreceiver call onercreceived like solution would erc store tx somewhat saving history state allowing uniswap read uniswap would able see sent coins would complicated expensive thus bad main problem way many erc tokens doesnt support ercreceiver one thing fixes problem starting use ercreceiver today little insentives somewhat complex implement receivers contract exists would take advantage tokens support forwarding writting ercreceiver would almost useless almost tokens support still think value starting use egg chiken problem starting use optional feature lack better option might drive usage future

Because of how the EVM is made.
You can't prevent thing that if ETH conspire against you and let thoses thing happend.

Secondly ""why does uniswap allows fake coins on the platform ?""
Because uniswap doesn't check anything, uniswap has been built thinking of decentralisation allowing anyone to list their coins. This also means that anyone can add their coins no matter what and buyers should check what they build.",,,fuck let shit happen evm made cant prevent thing eth conspire let thoses thing happend secondly uniswap allows fake coins platform uniswap doesnt check anything uniswap built thinking decentralisation allowing anyone list coins also means anyone add coins matter buyers check build

However changing the fee switch from a strategy to an other is totally possible and have no negative impact.",,,pairs would check factoryfeeto false ignoring fee switch code however important realise feeswitch isnt continuous happen someone remove liquidity pool someone added liquidity make profits feeswitch enabled fee switch disabled finally user remove liquidity profits would ignore fee switch avoid strategy lps best never turn least tell however changing fee switch strategy totally possible negative impact

372010870756081675,askar.,05/27/2021 3:01 AM,"okay so I have some thoughts on the Uni governance and wanted to share them. Could people let me know what they think

The first is the structure
-Some of the changes that I would think is needed is to decrease the threshold to create a proposal, this will not be on the main page but on a secondary/tertiary page  
-Reduce the threshold own to a much smaller dollar worth of UNI or a percent of market cap, then allow to reach a formal platform when it reaches lets say 100-1000x worth of UNI and then maybe 2-3x on top of that to the worth of UNI to be successful proposal. This would be pretty similar to the way COMP does it. 
So there will be three layers: one with most proposals... those that gain traction and hit the secondary threshold will go on a highlight page where those can see the main proposals...afterwards the third threshold is needed to officialize the proposal

The problem with UNI's governance is that not only does it make it *very*difficult to pass proposals (which honestly isn't to bad of a problem, should probably be reduced a little further) but more importantly, the ability to even ***propose*** an idea is tunneled down to only so many individuals. This makes the ability to propose **centralized**. This is counterintuitive to the point of decentralized governance. Thus, having these extra layers will allow for more conversation and decentralized method of gov. 

However, the parameters for the above thresholds should also vary with time
- the price of UNI 
- the number of uni ""active"" - not locked in cex's nor smart contracts (the rational behind this would be as governance becomes easier and common, then there would be more inflow of tokens into wallets and we would see it become easier to reach the above threshold. so you want to maintain the optimum difficulty despite more people joining)
-also circulating supply which would influence the above factor",,,okay thoughts uni governance wanted share could people let know think first structure changes would think needed decrease threshold create proposal main page secondarytertiary page reduce threshold much smaller dollar worth uni percent market cap allow reach formal platform reaches lets say x worth uni maybe x top worth uni successful proposal would pretty similar way comp three layers one proposals gain traction hit secondary threshold go highlight page see main proposalsafterwards third threshold needed officialize proposal problem unis governance make verydifficult pass proposals honestly isnt bad problem probably reduced little importantly ability even propose idea tunneled many individuals makes ability propose centralized counterintuitive point decentralized governance thus extra layers allow conversation decentralized method gov however parameters thresholds also vary time price uni number uni active locked cexs smart contracts rational behind would governance becomes easier common would inflow tokens wallets would see become easier reach threshold want maintain optimum difficulty despite people joining also circulating supply would influence factor

As a result of this proposal passing, I'm thinking two scenarios will play out both of which will result in the increase of proposals: 

1. More self-appointed delegates will emerge - ultimately leveling the playing field to some extent. I would not be surprised if this inspires the creation of cohort-like delegations. 

2. Closely intertwined with the #1, current delegates may experience an exodus, if you will, of voting power. This may benefit the community at large and insight more innovative, challenging, and community-driven ideas in the process.

I have now realized that in order to perform even a single query on TheGraph, I am required to pay in GRT.

This has perplexed and confused me in multiple levels...

1. Am I going about this the right way? Is there an on-chain way to perform my task that I am missing? ( I have asked over 5 times in the #ð»âdev-chat channel without receiving any response....)

2. If the only way to query uniV3 is through TheGraph... how does Uniswap DAO justify its data being only queryable through a paid / gated service? This sounds to be quite against the ""open-source"", ""blockchain open data"" philosophy...

3. How are other DAOs actively supporting this new, gated, single point of failure that TheGraph is?

4. I know and understand there are costs involved in maintaining this infrastructure, everyone knew this when TheGraph started and positioned itself as the ""single-source-of-truth"" for many queries... Is this now a matter of TheGraph leveraging their unique position in expense of the developers? Why aren't DAOs taking the brunt of the costs ~~and instead participate in the fees collected?~~ How does this make sense in an industry that so severely lacks application development?",,,ive going circles trying figure query univ liquidity pairs given pair tokens task quite trivial univ factory contract weeks asking asking around concluded feasible way using thegraph protocol via graphql queries realized order perform even single query thegraph required pay grt perplexed confused multiple levels going right way onchain way perform task missing asked times devchat channel without receiving response way query univ thegraph uniswap dao justify data queryable paid gated service sounds quite opensource blockchain open data philosophy daos actively supporting new gated single point failure thegraph know understand costs involved maintaining infrastructure everyone knew thegraph started positioned singlesourceoftruth many queries matter thegraph leveraging unique position expense developers arent daos taking brunt costs instead participate fees collected make sense industry severely lacks application development

1. When I go to the Uniswap governance portal at https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote, I only see 7 proposals. Does this mean there have only been 7 proposals that made it to an official vote in the history of Uniswap? If not, how can I see the full list of proposals that made it to an official vote? 

(I've also looked at the proposals at https://gov.uniswap.org/ and https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap but my understanding is that these do not represent binding votes. I read this first: https://gov.uniswap.org/t/community-governance-process/7732)

2. Does the list at https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote represent binding proposal votes for both v3 and v2, or does it represent binding proposals for v2 only? If v3 proposals are separate, is there somewhere I can find a list of binding proposals that have been put to a vote for v3? 

3. Was a successful governance vote required in order to deploy Uniswap on Optimism? 
- If so, can anyone share a link to the proposal and vote results to help me better understand the process?
- If not - and the Uniswap team can deploy to L2s or other chains without a governance vote having to take place - would there be no point for community members to start an official vote to deploy Uniswap on other L2s/chains like Arbitrum/Polygon? 

Even if deployments to other chains are not bound by governance, it seems like the community could still get the attention of the Uniswap team to suggest these things via Temperature and Consensus Checks. Please let me know if I'm on the right track here.",,,hi everyone couple noob questions governance uniswap go uniswap governance portal see proposals mean proposals made official vote history uniswap see full list proposals made official vote ive also looked proposals understanding represent binding votes read first list represent binding proposal votes v v represent binding proposals v v proposals separate somewhere find list binding proposals put vote v successful governance vote required order deploy uniswap optimism anyone share link proposal vote results help better understand process uniswap team deploy ls chains without governance vote take place would point community members start official vote deploy uniswap lschains like arbitrumpolygon even deployments chains bound governance seems like community could still get attention uniswap team suggest things via temperature consensus checks please let know im right track

But I think if you do that, people are realise that the exchange volume is big ok.
But UNI's market cap is enormous and doesn't line up with the reality of the current volume.

In other words.
Not making money allows UNI to be in a ""startup"" phase. You must not make money right now, because else people will want to know how much and realise that you suck.
What you do is that this startup phase you are a precious gem, and you are able to keep a high price, not with current revenues, but with a promise of even bigger future ones.
If UNI's price is that big right now, it's not because it has great benefits (the governance sits doing nothing most of the time and most of the rest of the time it's boring stuff, almost no one owns UNI because of only the governance), but because it promise way bigger benefits in the future (with a fee switch when uniswap does the trade volume of NYC Stock exchange for example).

If we enable fee switch right now it's possible that the market will start to see UNI not as a great future anymore but as a present that is pretty lame (0.4% APR is bad, and so would see the price crashing to a level where the APR is mostly alligned with the rest of the market).",,,yes fee switch speculation part dont take liable think people realise exchange volume big ok unis market cap enormous doesnt line reality current volume words making money allows uni startup phase must make money right else people want know much realise suck startup phase precious gem able keep high price current revenues promise even bigger future ones unis price big right great benefits governance sits nothing time rest time boring stuff almost one owns uni governance promise way bigger benefits future fee switch uniswap trade volume nyc stock exchange example enable fee switch right possible market start see uni great future anymore present pretty lame apr bad would see price crashing level apr mostly alligned rest market

ð§¡ððð Hi Uniswap Fam. I have made a Uni Gov post + Medium Article to propose a DHSM (Diamond Hands Staking Model). 

It is the best tokenomics in the game. I believe UNI can benefit from using it if we use it to distribute UNI rewards.

We can distribute them via Mining rewards in the next proposal or from the LP rewards if we turn the Protocol Fee switch on


Please have a read and comment I am welcome to all. 

The current issue is that many big DeFi whales, UNI holders included, keep voting NO to do any mining programs. They are protecting their bag because they do not want to grow. 

We need to use this DHSM (Diamond Hands Staking Model) to reward long-term UNI believers.

**The reason why the big whales hate the mining programs is because they just give out rewards to vulture dumpers. But with my model, you can distribute the rewards to people who commit to locking up UNI long-term. They get more rewards than those short-term. **

And people who exit early, pay an emergency stake and the rewards go to the believers (50% Treasury, 50% Believers)

Thanks for all commentary I am just trying to make us move forward in an optimal way... All information is in my post + medium article :uniswap:",,,hi uniswap fam made uni gov post medium article propose dhsm diamond hands staking model best tokenomics game believe uni benefit using use distribute uni rewards distribute via mining rewards next proposal lp rewards turn protocol fee switch please read comment welcome current issue many big defi whales uni holders included keep voting mining programs protecting bag want grow need use dhsm diamond hands staking model reward longterm uni believers reason big whales hate mining programs give rewards vulture dumpers model distribute rewards people commit locking uni longterm get rewards shortterm people exit early pay emergency stake rewards go believers treasury believers thanks commentary trying make us move forward optimal way information post medium article uniswap

For the recipient address in the Treasury Vester contracts (four of them), the current recipient is set to Timelock address. Timelock address has Governance address as its admin. The current recipient address of the Vester contract can change the recipient via `setRecipient` function. And since Timelock is the current recipient, and it's controlled by Governance, it means that Governance can change the recipient to a new address.

When you say ""malicious proposal"", it becomes more philosophical. For example, assuming the contracts have not been exploitable, and someone proposes that the recipient be changed to, say, the burn address, and the current holders of UNIs actually vote for that proposal, then yeah sure the vested UNIs will then start getting burned.

There is a team called Silo that is building something similar to Uniswap with a twist.
The improvement they bring is shared base tokens (i.e. in WBTC/ETH and MKR/ETH - ETH is the base token).
Otherwise it is much the same as Uniswap, but the shared base allows for higher capital efficiency.

If it works - is this something that Uniswap could copy to the Uni platform?

785786035400343582,ra00_,01/26/2022 6:30 AM,"Hi,
does anyone have more information on how governance works on layer 2?
As far as I know, there is only a governance system on L1 -> Governance calls need to take a bridge to L2.

I did some research:
For **Polygon**, they use **Fx-Portal:** Seems to be used to relay governance calls from mainnet to the UniswapV3 contracts on Polygon:
-> See Fx-Portal Contracts: https://polygonscan.com/address/0x8a1b966ac46f42275860f905dbc75efbfdc12374#readContract
-> `l1Owner` is set to the Uniswap `Timelock` (Ethereum mainnet) contract (i.e., L1 governance system).
-> The `UniswapV3Factory` contract on Polygon has set its `owner` to this `Fx-Portal EthereumProxy` contract.
So it looks like you can bridge governance calls from Ethereum Mainnet to Polygon via this `Fx-Portal `contracts, which will be recognized as `owner` by the UniswapV3 contracts on Polygon.

However, I am not sure how it will work for **Arbitrum** and **Optimism**:
UniswapV3Factory contract on Arbitrum: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984#readContract
-> `Owner` is set to the same address as the Ethereum Mainnet (L1) `Timelock` contract
However, all owner-checks in `UniswapV3Factory` are still written in the form `require(msg.sender == owner);`
But the Arbitrum documentation mentions that this will not work? (Quote: ""`msg.sender` â will not simply be the address of the contract on L1 that initiated the message; rather it will be the contract's ""L2 Alias."", https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages#address-aliasing)

Does Uniswap's implementation with `require(msg.sender == owner);` work on Arbitrum and Optimism?

However, there were some discussions in the first community call (around 8:00min)

In the UNI token launch blogpost, Uniswap Labs stated that the allocations for team members, future employees, investors, and advisors are subject to a 4-year vesting schedule (https://uniswap.org/blog/uni). But as far as I know this is not enforced through smart contracts, and the tokens appear to be fully liquid. I think the only vesting schedule transparently implemented on-chain is the one for the community treasury.

I am not entirely sure what you mean by ""community allocations."" But from a technical perspective: UNI tokens of the ""community treasury"" are not delegated right now. You can look up the UNI token contract on Etherscan to see that there is no delegate set for the Timelock contract address (owner of the community-treasury allocated UNI Tokens). Hence these tokens cannot be used for governance/voting purposes.",,,far know official statement really know however discussions first community call around min uni token launch blogpost uniswap labs stated allocations team members future employees investors advisors subject year vesting schedule far know enforced smart contracts tokens appear fully liquid think vesting schedule transparently implemented onchain one community treasury entirely sure mean community allocations technical perspective uni tokens community treasury delegated right look uni token contract etherscan see delegate set timelock contract address owner communitytreasury allocated uni tokens hence tokens used governancevoting purposes

This is Tommy from the Kava BD team. 

We're launching our ethereum co-chain this May and offering major incentives for tier-1 Defi projects like Uniswap to deploy on the Kava platform.

We're essentially giving away 200M Kava ($800M+ USD) for protocols who can  bring TVL onto the Kava platform. We've already launched our testnet, and giving an additional 100K Kava for projects who deploy early on testnet before May.  

We'd love for Uniswap to deploy on Kava and not only earn a bulk of the rewards, but build a strong and enduring partnership.

Any interest in setting up a chat with your & our team?

My understanding is that when a proposal passes the temperature check and consensus check, the proposal, in the form of codes, get implemented into the protocol's smart contracts. So governance is decentralized. However, when I checked the GitHub repository of uniswap V3 for instance, I see that there are only 11 contributors who are team members of Uniswap Labs and they are fixing buys and adding features to the protocol constantly. My understanding is that as Uniswap team members they do not need permission from the community to implement changes to the code. What I am trying to understand is, if the team members are able to independently change parts of the code for the protocol, couldn't there (theoretically) be changes or implementations that are not necessarily aligned with what the community wants? What are the things that team members are ""permissioned"" to do without consent of the community and what are some things that they cannot do unless it gets voted on? Thanks!",,,hi academic research daos wanted understand governance works uniswap understanding proposal passes temperature check consensus check proposal form codes get implemented protocols smart contracts governance decentralized however checked github repository uniswap v instance see contributors team members uniswap labs fixing buys adding features protocol constantly understanding uniswap team members need permission community implement changes code trying understand team members able independently change parts code protocol couldnt theoretically changes implementations necessarily aligned community wants things team members permissioned without consent community things unless gets voted thanks
617127949480493077,yj_alt,05/24/2022 4:27 PM,"Governance has three steps. Temperature Check and Consensus Check are off-chain Snapshot votes. Then there needs to be a formal on-chain proposal, encoded with the smart contract operations to be run. If that passes, the transaction can be executed.
https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/concepts/governance/process

The ""Protocol"" is mainly the smart contracts that have already been deployed, with admin rights handed over to the governance contract, which is in turn controlled by UNI token holders/voters via the process above. V3 has already been deployed, and cannot be changed directly by the Uniswap Labs team anymore. Any change that they can directly make is only for the UI (on app.uniswap.org) and any associated periphery functionalities (e.g. Auto Router in the swap router). Note that the UI and router(s) are just one of many that can be used to access the on-chain Uniswap core smart contracts. It is not compulsory to use the Labs UI and/or routers, e.g. you can see DEX aggregators using their own UI and routers to access the core Uniswap Protocol smart contract functionalities.

> My understanding is that as Uniswap team members they do not need permission from the community to implement changes to the code

Depends what you mean by the above. Uniswap Labs are the authors of the BUSL-licensed code for v3-core. They can build upon the code and redeploy if they want to, but they are not able to change/overwrite the existing v3-core smart contracts that have already been deployed onto the currently known addresses, as those are controlled by governance (see above). For example, without governance vote they can decide to deploy a new Uniswap-v3b to a new set of addresses, but IMO it's unlikely that liquidity+users will follow and migrate over, unless there is overwhelmingly good reason/incentive to support their new v3b.",,,governance three steps temperature check consensus check offchain snapshot votes needs formal onchain proposal encoded smart contract operations run passes transaction executed protocol mainly smart contracts already deployed admin rights handed governance contract turn controlled uni token holdersvoters via process v already deployed changed directly uniswap labs team anymore change directly make ui appuniswaporg associated periphery functionalities eg auto router swap router note ui routers one many used access onchain uniswap core smart contracts compulsory use labs ui andor routers eg see dex aggregators using ui routers access core uniswap protocol smart contract functionalities understanding uniswap team members need permission community implement changes code depends mean uniswap labs authors busllicensed code vcore build upon code redeploy want able changeoverwrite existing vcore smart contracts already deployed onto currently known addresses controlled governance see example without governance vote decide deploy new uniswapvb new set addresses imo unlikely liquidityusers follow migrate unless overwhelmingly good reasonincentive support new vb

So Uniswap Labs team can directly implement changes to the periphery functionalities but not the core code itself, and the UI that we usually access is the one where these functionalities are incorporated. But users can choose not to use these peripheral functions and utilize the smart contract however they want. And when the team decides to deploy something new, lets say a v4, users can always choose to use the older version or even fork the smart contract. If I were to try and compare the ""administrative power"" of Uniswap Lab's team to another protocol say Aave, how do you think I should go about doing it? Would you say teams of different projects have different levels of admin power over the protocol or would you say its more less the same where there is a core smart contract that the team can't touch but a set of peripheral contracts that the team can freely work on?

The idea of testing this out with V3 having full control over which pools have this fee switch and how much

my proposal is that we create a Staking contract in conjunction of the fee switch contract receiver, and also adding on a ERC20 Wrapped UNI where this wrapped Uni is used in a ETH/WUNI pool, allowing this to be unwrapped as well via contract.

This would allow UNI holders to stake the uni and provide that wrapped UNI to the pool to limit loss from the fees lost in the LP, Also having a UNI/WUNI pool would allow routing through this pool with regular UNI token routes

Now the main reason we can bring in UNI LP providers is that in this contract we would want to retain UNI Holder Voting rights, the Vote would need to be done via this contract and have a ipfs site to vote on, but by tracking and setting the users ability to send vote via the contracts holding of their UNI, this would allow them to still Vote, although a different delegate system would also have to be set up

But by reducing the loss in LP fees and allowing UNI holders to keep their voting power, I do believe this would be enough incentive for LP providers of UNI token at least

Obviously this would be a very complicated contract, but I do believe that this would offer a good incentive to open a Fee Switch Testing pool",,ð§  (1),last community call got thinking fee switch ways overcome obsticles creating outside contract idea testing v full control pools fee switch much proposal create staking contract conjunction fee switch contract receiver also adding erc wrapped uni wrapped uni used ethwuni pool allowing unwrapped well via contract would allow uni holders stake uni provide wrapped uni pool limit loss fees lost lp also uniwuni pool would allow routing pool regular uni token routes main reason bring uni lp providers contract would want retain uni holder voting rights vote would need done via contract ipfs site vote tracking setting users ability send vote via contracts holding uni would allow still vote although different delegate system would also set reducing loss lp fees allowing uni holders keep voting power believe would enough incentive lp providers uni token least obviously would complicated contract believe would offer good incentive open fee switch testing pool

**Proposal**

This post is gauging interest and collaborators in formally proposing that 1% of Uniswap transaction fees go towards RedemptionDAO.

**What is RedemptionDAO?**

27 Million Hectares of protected rainforest are up for auction in the Congo. This is a larger plot of land than all of the National Parks in the USA combined. The bidders are oil companies looking to exploit the land for resources. A grassroots team of over 200 Web3 environmentalists formed RedemptionDAO (redemptionDAO on twitter) to try to raise the funds to win the auction, allowing the continued protection of the land by helping the community earn carbon credits for the avoided deforestation of the peatlands and trees in this area. Donors have already pledged $74,000 but this isnât enough. Uniswap has the opportunity to show the world that web3 can make positive change in the world. 

**Impact**

Uniswap has the chance to make an impact on the climate crisis, raise awareness about the DAO, and change the public perception of crypto. Additionally, climate crypto is based on Celo (which Uniswap is the recommended DEX for use by the Celo community). Driving liquidity towards climate action would likely increase transaction volume on Uniswap.",,,temperature check forum wasnt letting post thought id survey interest trying see anyone would want collaborate proposal proposal post gauging interest collaborators formally proposing uniswap transaction fees go towards redemptiondao redemptiondao million hectares protected rainforest auction congo larger plot land national parks usa combined bidders oil companies looking exploit land resources grassroots team web environmentalists formed redemptiondao redemptiondao twitter try raise funds win auction allowing continued protection land helping community earn carbon credits avoided deforestation peatlands trees area donors already pledged isnt enough uniswap opportunity show world web make positive change world impact uniswap chance make impact climate crisis raise awareness dao change public perception crypto additionally climate crypto based celo uniswap recommended dex use celo community driving liquidity towards climate action would likely increase transaction volume uniswap

998239149544968272,el_primo9474,08/17/2022 11:00 AM,"Dear Uniswap community, I am Vincent, I hope you are all well. 

I am contacting you to provide our expertise in governance when it comes to the subject of DAOs. 
We are a team of academic researchers, blockchain developers, lawyers, financiers and political scientists who have been working for over 10 years to develop a scientific paradigm for collective decision making, at the intersection of social choice theory, welfare economics, decentralized artificial intelligence, collective intelligence and strategic marketing. 

We have introduced decision rules that offer expressiveness and usability, robustness in the way they analyze information, limited manipulability and scalability. 

The rules are tailor-made: governors can strategically orient the collective decision between performance, equity and consensuality.
We have solved the Condorcet Paradox: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_paradox 
which is a 200 year old problem on governance. 

I know that there are many pain points in DAOs and the governance of blockchains protocols nowadays and there are still many challenges to overcome regarding:
- Consensus Mechanism
- Tokenization Mechanism
- Voting Mechanism
- Smart Contract Mechanism.

By working with us you will get assured to get the best recommendations/product which fit your market needs.
Do not hesitate to contact me back if this is of interests to you.

Kind Regards.


Vincent

What do people think about a partially anonymous forum? Has anyone censored their controversial ideas due to fear of social reprisals? What have you done if your idea goes against the big players in the DAO? Can partial anonymity be a way to start addressing group think?

I understand that social reputation is important in qualifying the ideas but, it also gets in the way of viewing ideas based on its merits. In certain cases, we censor our controversial comments because it goes against the grain of the majority of DAOs and we tend to not point that out because of fear of social reprisal. Again, this may get in the way of having the most effective decision as some ideas are not considered (and that âconsensusâ is a more of a capitulation than general agreement that we have the best idea.)

I believe that certain topics may require an anon space to assess the ideas by its merits rather than rely too heavily on the social representation (albeit it has an important role in the DAO). 

How do you think anon forums would impact the quality of forum discussions?",,,hello uniswap community trying market survey mature dao like uniswap plz dont ban people think partially anonymous forum anyone censored controversial ideas due fear social reprisals done idea goes big players dao partial anonymity way start addressing group think understand social reputation important qualifying ideas also gets way viewing ideas based merits certain cases censor controversial comments goes grain majority daos tend point fear social reprisal may get way effective decision ideas considered consensus capitulation general agreement best idea believe certain topics may require anon space assess ideas merits rather rely heavily social representation albeit important role dao think anon forums would impact quality forum discussions

597027097914900490,PLAY#3825,12/01/2022 12:49 PM,"MY Proposal
In support of furthering the vision of Multichain Uniswap, proposing that the Uniswap community vote to authorize the deployment of Uniswap bridge. We hope this proposal will serve as an example to create a generalizable, trust-minimized approach to cross-chain deployments, with the goal of supporting a multichain Uniswap ecosystem.

As implied in the name, bridges allow one to easily migrate tokens from one chain to another. 

For example converting from Ethereum to Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Celo you will need to have some ETH in your Ethereum wallet to cover gas fees when converting. Similarly user should be able to migrate from the different chains supported by Uniswap

For this we would be creating separate tab in the home page of Uniswap.

Example use case
To switch between Ethereum and Arbitrum:
Click on the ""Bridge"" tab, and select ""Arbitrum Bridge"":

This will take you to the Arbitrum Token Bridge, where you can connect your wallet and ""deposit/withdraw"" tokens to and from the Arbitrum network.

Conclusion
Uniswap as community together we can serve as the foundation for the proliferation of natural capital assets across Web3. We believe that the vision to advance decentralization of financial services. Thank you for your consideration and we welcome questions and suggestions.",,,proposal support furthering vision multichain uniswap proposing uniswap community vote authorize deployment uniswap bridge hope proposal serve example create generalizable trustminimized approach crosschain deployments goal supporting multichain uniswap ecosystem implied name bridges allow one easily migrate tokens one chain another example converting ethereum arbitrum optimism polygon celo need eth ethereum wallet cover gas fees converting similarly user able migrate different chains supported uniswap would creating separate tab home page uniswap example use case switch ethereum arbitrum click bridge tab select arbitrum bridge take arbitrum token bridge connect wallet depositwithdraw tokens arbitrum network conclusion uniswap community together serve foundation proliferation natural capital assets across web believe vision advance decentralization financial services thank consideration welcome questions suggestions

We want to share with you an analysis on Uniswap Stickiness that we did at Almanak.
**TL;DR**: 
- And because of the occurrence of triangular inter-pool trading within Uniswap pools, measuring and understanding stickiness is challenging.

- Even though we could still imply it from the other pools (used for triangular spillovers) change in activity post-switch vs historical levels, itâs difficult to disentangle what share of that activity would be resulting from which pool among the three activated pools.

- Stickiness (of trading and liquidity) is very pool-specific.

- From our analysis ETH-DAI 0.05% and ETH-USDC 1% would not be too impacted by this side effect. The former a bit more than the latter due to whale behaviour.

- However ETH-USDT 0.3% seems more prone, with #jit playing a role on liquidity and #curve on trading volume.

Overall outcome is clearly agent-driven so the experimentation will benefit from incorporating behavioural analysis through simulation.

**Thesis:**

This proposal seeks to deploy a 1bp fee tier for UniswapV3 on Arbitrum. This will allow users to trade with lower fees, making it more accessible and competitive with other decentralized exchanges.

Since the launch on mainnet, there seems to be enough data to prove the effectiveness of a 1bp fee tier in increasing swap volume for Uniswap.

Currently, the Uniswap 1bp fee tier is live on the mainnet, Optimism and Polygon. Based on data and the impact itâll have on the trading volumes, thereâs no reason for it not to exist for Arbitrum.

Regarding deploying Uniswap on different chains and L2 solutions. I agree, some of the deployments are happening on chains that traded off decentralization for scaling/speed and fees. It seems like Uniswap governance doesn't think that those are deal breakers and is willing to deploy on these solutions as well.

With that said, making Uniswap available on these solutions doesn't affect in any way Uniswap on Ethereum L1 or rollup scaling solutions. It is not that we are shutting down Ethereum deployment and are completely switching to BSC. We are just giving people option to choose. And, in my opinion, when you look at it that way there is no reason for Uniswap not to be present on those chains as well. Furthermore, some of these solutions might adopt POS and go decentralized in the future and then we might regret not having first mover advantage.

Data backs that also. We have Celo deployment but people don't think it is best place for them. That is why adoption on it is lacking. We just gave people option to choose, nobody is making people switch from solutions they feel comfortable interacting with to go to these new solutions.

Regarding whales swinging votes in Uniswap governance. Yes, whales have big influence in Uniswap governance but over time their influence should became less and less dominant. As more people get into UNI token less and less voting power will be in hands of whales and in the future we might see less whale domination in voting.",,,awbvious pinged proposers couldnt get insight seems everyone busy selecting bridge bsc deployment regarding deploying uniswap different chains l solutions agree deployments happening chains traded decentralization scalingspeed fees seems like uniswap governance doesnt think deal breakers willing deploy solutions well said making uniswap available solutions doesnt affect way uniswap ethereum l rollup scaling solutions shutting ethereum deployment completely switching bsc giving people option choose opinion look way reason uniswap present chains well furthermore solutions might adopt pos go decentralized future might regret first mover advantage data backs also celo deployment people dont think best place adoption lacking gave people option choose nobody making people switch solutions feel comfortable interacting go new solutions regarding whales swinging votes uniswap governance yes whales big influence uniswap governance time influence became less less dominant people get uni token less less voting power hands whales future might see less whale domination voting

I was most surprised that someone at cointelegraph even /thought/ that Uniswap was ""ditching"" Ethereum, or that such an error got past their editorial staff.  Someone should reach out for a retraction/correction.  ""As more people get into UNI token""--but there's a fundamental logic block to that...  Right now, 8 UNI holders can sway a vote.  8.  Why would any regular person think they can compete with that?  In, say, most IRL political voting, it's one vote per person.  If you knew your vote was worth one millionth of, say, the top 8 richest people in the land, it would be pretty discouraging.  Now, if UNI was profit-sharing like some others out there that, you know, recently surpassed Uniswap in trading volume (something that would be unheard of until recently), maybe you'd get more people out there interested in UNI, but right now?  If anything I see /less/ interest in UNI as time goes on, and more in other decentralized exchanges that give profit sharing and other unique features like leverage.  Of course, that's tricky, Uniswap has already had to censor its front end for regulators/authorities, start doing leverage or profit sharing... yeah...  But, put in quadratic voting or something like that, and I doubt regulators would care.  In fact I suspect it would /help/ Uniswap in the eyes of regulators.  Because if power is in the hands of 8 individuals it looks more like ""expectation of profit based on the efforts of others,"" while more power to more people means more any expectations would be in the efforts of one's self--and that's not even looking at anti-trust/monopoly concerns.",,,specifically regarding shutting ethereum deployment completely switching bsc realized reach cointelegraph correction surprised someone cointelegraph even thought uniswap ditching ethereum error got past editorial staff someone reach retractioncorrection people get uni tokenbut theres fundamental logic block right uni holders sway vote would regular person think compete say irl political voting one vote per person knew vote worth one millionth say top richest people land would pretty discouraging uni profitsharing like others know recently surpassed uniswap trading volume something would unheard recently maybe youd get people interested uni right anything see less interest uni time goes decentralized exchanges give profit sharing unique features like leverage course thats tricky uniswap already censor front end regulatorsauthorities start leverage profit sharing yeah put quadratic voting something like doubt regulators would care fact suspect would help uniswap eyes regulators power hands individuals looks like expectation profit based efforts others power people means expectations would efforts ones selfand thats even looking antitrustmonopoly concerns

829495717403295784,awbvious,02/02/2023 1:32 AM,"Another thing to consider is voting for a non-whale is a lot of risk for a lot less (potential) benefit.  Once there's a way to vote on a Dapp, there's likely not going to be any airdrops to reward engagement.  Because the way to vote on the Dapp is very likely because of the one and only airdrop the Dapp will ever have: namely an airdrop of a governance token.  There's been moments of bandying about of another Uniswap drop, and I doubt that will ever happen (see previous point about power consolidation and desire for status quo by those in power).   So, your vote is unlikely to matter, and you're unlikely to get an airdrop.  Now, what kind of risk is there?  Look at Ooki (originally known as BZeroX or bZx).  Something very few people have mentioned (but myself, in fact I don't know of anyone else mentioning it / aware of it), is that the CFTC went after anyone who voted on an Ooki proposals, ostensibly as a way to ""go after"" the DAO and discourage devs who think they can ""hide behind"" a DAO.  But that's ridiculous a) because they didn't just go after votes that are specifically related to the actions Ooki was (is?) taking that they dislike (leverage without KYC and presumably even then only for accredited individuals) and b) you'd have to be ridiculously wealthy in Ooki/BZRX tokens to even be able to propose--like $100k in either to be able to propose.  They should have only gone after at least those who voted and fit b, and very possibly both a and b (if anyone at all, because that assumes a handful of devs can afford or should afford to maintain the necessary programs for compliance for regulation that isn't even defined AND the underlying regulation may just be gatekeeping for rich people who are just assumed to be better investors)... but I'm digressing.

But I just had a thought.  Maybe include something like the slashing that occurs to bad-faith validators in Proof of Staking, but have it for voting who do it bad-faith voting like sybil voting.  In many ways, it's a similar thing.  You don't have to know how to detect sybillism.   You just have to make the punishment a big enough deterrent that it's not worth it to attempt.  Slashing wouldn't work on everyone, but I think it absolutely work on someone like a16z.  Their reputation is too important to them to risk it by manipulating governance on any one vote or any one dapp.  I think it would work--it wouldn't be reinventing the wheel, it would be using a wheel that's working really well already on PoS, but putting it on a different type of vehicle.  Eventually, solutions will come around to detect sybillism--account reputation, using AI to see patterns between connections of accounts and voting history (thankfully both on chain, making it easier), a process for accusing voters and voters having a process for defending themselves--but in the meantime slashing could be turned on immediately with quadratic voting and that should alone contain the threat.

Wormhole and Solana are both big investments, and a massive mint exploit cost them dearly in bailout, but likely worse if they hadn't bailed out Wormhole.  Jump Crypto is probably even more invested in Wormhole now, and probably a lot of BSC.

In 2020 we released the first stablecoin that earns a yield while sitting in your wallet, the Origin Dollar (OUSD). The yield is generated by tapping into multiple protocols such as Aave, Compound, Morpho, and Curve. As of February 3rd, Origin governance ratified a proposal to have a Uniswap V3 strategy for yield: https://snapshot.org/#/ousdgov.eth/proposal/0xe76cf1d102c4c119e2cef6584731cc228c9793c44187b5dcfab1a75fd038f55f 
The TLDR from this ratification is that Origin will soon be depositing millions of dollars into Uniswap, indefinitely. 

The problem however, is that the two tokens we need to utilize this strategy, OUSD and OGV, are both currently blocked with a warning sign on the platform (see screenshot). We have reached out to support@uniswap.org, opened multiple support tickets, and reached out to @Anthony ð¦ // Community Manager, to remove this warning but are still seeing it on the Uniswap V3 dex. At this point a governance proposal to the Uniswap DAO may be the only feasible way to remove this warning. 

Have there been any proposals to remove the warning sign in the past? Or is there a template somewhere for proposals of this nature? Weâre not just minting assets that might generate trading fees, weâre going to be depositing millions of dollars here.",https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755969053280960533/1077656609746059364/IMG_0339.jpg,,hello peter origin protocol released first stablecoin earns yield sitting wallet origin dollar ousd yield generated tapping multiple protocols aave compound morpho curve february rd origin governance ratified proposal uniswap v strategy yield tldr ratification origin soon depositing millions dollars uniswap indefinitely problem however two tokens need utilize strategy ousd ogv currently blocked warning sign platform see screenshot reached supportuniswaporg opened multiple support tickets reached anthony community manager remove warning still seeing uniswap v dex point governance proposal uniswap dao may feasible way remove warning proposals remove warning sign past template somewhere proposals nature minting assets might generate trading fees going depositing millions dollars
