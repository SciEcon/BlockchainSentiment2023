Before going into that, if anyone have idea about Synthetix now and how it is grown since last year.

Synthetix firstly had fixed supply of 100 million and they introduced minting model to get supply of sUSD into the market. Intially not much interested to do mint from most of community holders of SNX, because there is no proper incentivisation for them to do the task. But the team didn't give up. And so many discussions happened around discord to increase the supply of SNX to bootstrap the product. Team and community believed that the inflation will outweigh the network effect valuation it brings on table. Now we are seeing the results of this model as perfect mechanism and price of SNX increased significantly from 0.05cents to 3.6$. Now it becomes a perfect example to every other DeFi projects whoever wants to get their project bootstrap by their community. Recent Projects as Examples : Balancer, Curve, mStable, COMP, Kava etc.,. 

Not only this, incentivisation for LP also introduced by Synthetix in first for sETH/ETH liquidity to get into the Synthetix ecosystem from Crypto world.

From the above what we can understand is Inflation is necessary to get the attention of crypto community towards to the project. And Network effect valuation will definitely outweigh the inflation if the project has more to offer to its community in the future. This will bring more valuation to YFI price.

I suggest YFI should be having inflationary which in decreasing trend in a curved manner(gradual decrease) instead of step manner(sudden decrease).",,,try give view whether mint yfi going anyone idea synthetix grown since last year synthetix firstly fixed supply million introduced minting model get supply susd market intially much interested mint community holders snx proper incentivisation task team didnt give many discussions happened around discord increase supply snx bootstrap product team community believed inflation outweigh network effect valuation brings table seeing results model perfect mechanism price snx increased significantly cents becomes perfect example every defi projects whoever wants get project bootstrap community recent projects examples balancer curve mstable comp kava etc incentivisation lp also introduced synthetix first setheth liquidity get synthetix ecosystem crypto world understand inflation necessary get attention crypto community towards project network effect valuation definitely outweigh inflation project offer community future bring valuation yfi price suggest yfi inflationary decreasing trend curved mannergradual decrease instead step mannersudden decrease

The latter is volatile the former is not. Secondly, for users/LPs, I think a valid point was made about limiting LP exposure to fluctuations and properly utilizing yCRV. So 60/40 or 80/20 yCRV/YFI seem sensible. The other issue with an 80/20 YFI/yCRV pool, participation in which I presume is required for voting, will exclude small holders from governance participation a bit--since it will force folks who have not earned YFI to buy more or convert their yCRV into YFI--which is far riskier.

YFI looks like a great project, endorsing governance with a token that hasn't been premined.
Within a week near 30k tokens were mined allowing owners to choose the direction of the project.
I understand the reason of keeping the supply low to reward early adopters but we are talking about a project that has been live around a week. 
Sure crypto moves fast but doesn't that seem extremely short for adoption and teaching others what is YFI? Wouldn't giving more incentive to newcomers make the whole system healthier?
The 2 sides are extremes:
- Adopter since day 0 dont want to have their share diluted, a lot of hype around the project
- newcomer, wants to participate but tokens already cost way more than anticipated

Maybe I'm missing something, is there a reason why to keep the issuance of another 20k over 5/10 years reasonable?

Just trying to understand both sides of the coin.
Hope this sparks meaningful discussions",,,hey unsure sensible put go yfi looks like great project endorsing governance token hasnt premined within week near k tokens mined allowing owners choose direction project understand reason keeping supply low reward early adopters talking project live around week sure crypto moves fast doesnt seem extremely short adoption teaching others yfi wouldnt giving incentive newcomers make whole system healthier sides extremes adopter since day dont want share diluted lot hype around project newcomer wants participate tokens already cost way anticipated maybe im missing something reason keep issuance another k years reasonable trying understand sides coin hope sparks meaningful discussions

Currently we have nexus mutual as an option for insurance. That system, for valid reasons, requires KYC. I personally (and Iâm sure many others) are not interested in the product because of the KYC aspect.

One good thing about using nexus mutual is it insures the contracts themselves, so it covers people locking up funds in yVault etc.

I donât think buying put options on YFI could match what nexus covers, since YFI value is distinct from stable coin value risked.

But I guess why I bring this up is that buying into YFI implicitly means you are exposed to the similar risks that liquidity providers are exposed to. If liquidity providers lose funds to a bug, not necessarily because of the yearn contracts but some other DeFi contract, then the YFI token presumably loses value 

If there were no way for YFI holders, specifically those YFI holders that want to exercise governance rights, to protect the value they possess during such a scenario, then could that mean that governance itself could fall apart? What I mean is that would people sell and not have any reason to govern any more and effectively kill the project?

I hope this isnât too hypothetical of a scenario",,,substreight brainlet would like help try explain thinking hopefully kind discourse spawned currently nexus mutual option insurance system valid reasons requires kyc personally im sure many others interested product kyc aspect one good thing using nexus mutual insures contracts covers people locking funds yvault etc dont think buying put options yfi could match nexus covers since yfi value distinct stable coin value risked guess bring buying yfi implicitly means exposed similar risks liquidity providers exposed liquidity providers lose funds bug necessarily yearn contracts defi contract yfi token presumably loses value way yfi holders specifically yfi holders want exercise governance rights protect value possess scenario could mean governance could fall apart mean would people sell reason govern effectively kill project hope isnt hypothetical scenario

Some portion of the issuance  could be sent to an options protocol. The YFI would be locked up and used as collateral for the market. 

This has multiple benefits. One would be it signals a commitment to security. Another would be it actually provides some level of security. And the final I can think of is it can show people that itâs not a bad idea to sell options on their YFI, making the insurance on YFI itself better for us all. 

The reason why this wouldnât make sense I guess is the issuance dedicated  is minuscule compared to the amount of YFI circulating. But I argue that itâs good for a large portion of people since theyâre not going to be whales anyway

I may think of some more thing but I hope this is enough for now.

So if you have yfi tokens, to earn your share of fees, you have to stake them via the ygov V2 website.

Then in order to actually receive rewards you have to vote on a proposal first and then wait 3 days?

If there are no proposals, the fees just keep piling up in the background waiting for another vote before they can be dispersed?

Can you just leave your yfi staked in gov indefinitely?

@banteg I don't think anyone wants to attack Andre personally. Or YFI. The inclusion of the 2nd option in the proposal was probably what set a lot of people off. Frankly that was a really bad idea. Just the perception that YFI was considering to just take it and put it into the treasury clouded everything. As it stands, It seems like the lock option is reasonable.

atm. our base strategy is to farm and dump to increase the # of base asset we farm with. which gives us great ROI and awesome for everyone using the vaults
as a negative side we put a huge sell pressure on the projects we use and I think we started to get some sort of a bad name on the projects we benefit from (where ever we rotate our liquidity, the price drops)... looking at the cream and crv we basically hurt the fellow farmers (especially the smaller ones)... low roi + low capital + high gas fees, we basically force people to join us or become non-profitable...

Even though this strategy  is highly profitable atm. This farming craze will end at some point and I think we should start positioning ourselves in a way we can influence the future of the defi in a way to benefit us the most...

Idea dump:
- add an additional parameter to vaults where we can determine the % of the yield we keep (eg: we keep 25% of the yield and dump the rest 75%)
- we put those gov. tokens in the tresury and play an active role on the future of those protocols. 
- maybe select ambassadors who are interested in the dealings of those protocols and incentivize them to communicate in the best interest of YFI.  eg: if we had ~10-15% of the total crv supply we'd have a good amount of power over the protocol to influence the future of the project...
- every YFI holder has a claim on the % of those tokens. let's say if you have 1% of the YFI you have claim on 0.75% of the loot. (the 25% for the warchest maybe?)
- YFI holders can ragequit and sell their YFI back to the system and get their claim. that YFI can either be added back to the be `re-farmed` or distributed equally amongst the people who stake YFI.",,,sure right place sort idea wanted hear think atm base strategy farm dump increase base asset farm gives us great roi awesome everyone using vaults negative side put huge sell pressure projects use think started get sort bad name projects benefit ever rotate liquidity price drops looking cream crv basically hurt fellow farmers especially smaller ones low roi low capital high gas fees basically force people join us become nonprofitable even though strategy highly profitable atm farming craze end point think start positioning way influence future defi way benefit us idea dump add additional parameter vaults determine yield keep eg keep yield dump rest put gov tokens tresury play active role future protocols maybe select ambassadors interested dealings protocols incentivize communicate best interest yfi eg total crv supply wed good amount power protocol influence future project every yfi holder claim tokens lets say yfi claim loot warchest maybe yfi holders ragequit sell yfi back system get claim yfi either added back refarmed distributed equally amongst people stake yfi

I really don't like the idea of this protocol having a 'lead dev' - would prefer having a few lead editors. 
Here are ways that could work:  

- A bounty system: % of dev grants allocated per YIP depending on a variable like front end or vault code. this way we know how much each YIP will cost and not just vote ""yes"" on everything. after YIP is passed, code will be voted on. Whoever gets there first / has the ideal code gets % dev grant bounty. 
- Normalize code being drafted before YIP is passed: If the code doesn't need too much work, then the person who pitched will receive % dev grant at the lead editors' discretion

In this system, Andre could be a lead editor with a steady income, be paid for bounties if he can code it fast and the best or he could draft code before pitching. 

In my opinion, what's best for longevity is to incentivize creativity and hard work. We are fortunate to be participating in an open protocol where any dev can make a name for themselves. We want to attract creative people and ensure that they will get paid for being better than others. In this system, Andre will also be able to innovate without the protocol revolving around him. 

Consider that he says he gets bored from things easily and likes to move on when a puzzle is solved.",,,sorry im dumb ignorant havent seen much information related topic yet really dont like idea protocol lead dev would prefer lead editors ways could work bounty system dev grants allocated per yip depending variable like front end vault code way know much yip cost vote yes everything yip passed code voted whoever gets first ideal code gets dev grant bounty normalize code drafted yip passed code doesnt need much work person pitched receive dev grant lead editors discretion system andre could lead editor steady income paid bounties code fast best could draft code pitching opinion whats best longevity incentivize creativity hard work fortunate participating open protocol dev make name want attract creative people ensure get paid better others system andre also able innovate without protocol revolving around consider says gets bored things easily likes move puzzle solved

If you're in the gov staking pool, you'll affect the quorum needed. So, in some cases, if many people aren't voting, your vote may still be important. (e.g. see how YIP 43 was rejected due to lack of quorum.)

@banteg My problem with weight decay is you have to constantly refresh your ""lock"" like currently on veCRV

But now that I think about it some more, this problem can be easily avoided by doing the following:

1. Send YFI to SC with ""infinite lock time"" while also telling it how much time-weight you want (say 1 yr)
2. The SC doesn't automatically allow you to withdraw after 1 yr, and your weight doesn't decay. Instead,
3. You call an SC ""withdraw-signal"" function which tells it to unlock your YFI within a year. Only when this function is called, your weight starts decaying
4. You get to collect your YFI either on a timed-release or at the end of that 1yr

Example:
1. Wallet A tells SC it wants the maximum weight (say 1yr), but really, Wallet A wants to stake for 2 years and doesn't want to constantly refresh their stake during the first year
2. Wallet A lets YFI sit in the SC for a year, without interaction with the SC (gas). The SC doesn't decay their weight because the ""withdraw-signal"" function haven't been called
3. Wallet A calls ""withdraw-signal"" after year 1 is up, planning to withdraw at the end of year 2
4. SC processes the call, starts decaying weight
5. Wallet A collects time-released YFI or the whole lump sum at the end of year 2",,,imagine buildup fuck protocol dump people still figuring whats wrong decay cant banteg problem weight decay constantly refresh lock like currently vecrv think problem easily avoided following send yfi sc infinite lock time also telling much timeweight want say yr sc doesnt automatically allow withdraw yr weight doesnt decay instead call sc withdrawsignal function tells unlock yfi within year function called weight starts decaying get collect yfi either timedrelease end yr example wallet tells sc wants maximum weight say yr really wallet wants stake years doesnt want constantly refresh stake first year wallet lets yfi sit sc year without interaction sc gas sc doesnt decay weight withdrawsignal function havent called wallet calls withdrawsignal year planning withdraw end year sc processes call starts decaying weight wallet collects timereleased yfi whole lump sum end year
1.97856e+17,beepidibop,2020/9/12 ä¸å8:05,2020/9/12 ,"Edit: On deposit, the staker can tell the SC how long their ""withdraw-signal"" should last, and that is used to determine their weight.

Example:
1. Wallet B haven't made up their mind on how long to stake, but figures a 3day notice satisfy their needs.
2. Wallet B tells the SC their withdraw-signal should be 3 days long while depositing, SC determines their weight to be 3 days.
3. Wallet B goes MIA for 6 months, weight doesn't decay (still remaining 3 days).
4. Wallet B signals after 6 months, retrieve coins in 6months+3days, while having 3day weight up until 6months, and start decaying when the ""withdraw-signal"" is called.

And there should probably be a function that lengthens your signal period so you don't have to wait to unstake then stake again . But there shouldn't be one for shortening the period",,,edit deposit staker tell sc long withdrawsignal last used determine weight example wallet b havent made mind long stake figures day notice satisfy needs wallet b tells sc withdrawsignal days long depositing sc determines weight days wallet b goes mia months weight doesnt decay still remaining days wallet b signals months retrieve coins monthsdays day weight months start decaying withdrawsignal called probably function lengthens signal period dont wait unstake stake shouldnt one shortening period

@banteg I'd view it more akin to a sort of vesting period for the staking. E.G. voting power (and commensurate rewards) goes from 0.5 -> 2 over the course of a year, and caps out there.  That way folks are incentivized to leave their YFI in the governance for a longer period of time, and external antagonists who want to snap up YFI, maliciously vote, and then flee will have a reduced vote capacity.",,,imagine buildup fuck protocol dump people still figuring whats wrong decay cant banteg id view akin sort vesting period staking eg voting power commensurate rewards goes course year caps way folks incentivized leave yfi governance longer period time external antagonists want snap yfi maliciously vote flee reduced vote capacity

From what I understand, the only way to claim your rewards is to vote on a proposal. However, if there are no proposals, rewards are effectively locked for an unforseable time. 

Would it be possible to set up a system where stakers are able to claim rewards at predetermined times regardless of there being a proposal to vote. I can see ""empty"" proposals happening just so stakers could claim rewards.  Maybe have the system set up for every Yearly Quarter a harvest proposal happens so stakers have an option. This would allow stakers to not depend on proposals to happen to claim their rewards.

Hope that makes sense. I posted in the yip planning but I'm not sure if that was the right room -_-",,,might planning way far ahead future might misunderstand current way harvest rewards staking understand way claim rewards vote proposal however proposals rewards effectively locked unforseable time would possible set system stakers able claim rewards predetermined times regardless proposal vote see empty proposals happening stakers could claim rewards maybe system set every yearly quarter harvest proposal happens stakers option would allow stakers depend proposals happen claim rewards hope makes sense posted yip planning im sure right room

@dripdrop WOOFYFI 10BTC 

Let me try to summarise so far. 

LearnYearn, here: (https://www.learnyearn.finance/start-here/yfi-revenue-model) states that it is fee generation that is contributing to the treasury.

Anything above $500k into the treasury will start paying out fees to YFI token holders. 

The address for the treasury is the following: 

https://etherscan.io/address/0xfeb4acf3df3cdea7399794d0869ef76a6efaff52#internaltx

If you look at the cumulative value held in the treasury over time, you  can see that it only once blips above $500k

So that would suggest that reward payments should have only happened once. 

However as mentioned by @Bob_The_Buidler | YFIStats.com People have actually been getting paid for staking even when the treasury is not above $500k. At least currently through the Earn product or through the Ycrv withdrawal fees as @dripdrop WOOFYFI 10BTC mentions. 

Then I have a question:

>Is there any YiP or anything written by the developers that explains the current reward mechanisms for staking? So we can get clarity and try to predict how this may scale in the future.",,,like owning lines business taking cash one ignoring others accumulate dripdrop woofyfi btc let try summarise far learnyearn states fee generation contributing treasury anything k treasury start paying fees yfi token holders address treasury following look cumulative value held treasury time see blips k would suggest reward payments happened however mentioned bobthebuidler yfistatscom people actually getting paid staking even treasury k least currently earn product ycrv withdrawal fees dripdrop woofyfi btc mentions question yip anything written developers explains current reward mechanisms staking get clarity try predict may scale future
7.50961e+17,.toranagasama,2020/9/20 ä¸å6:02,2020/9/20 ,"Thanks for the summary @LivioRazlo 

I think that perhaps one of the first steps (and perhaps I'm behind here) is to figure out how to communicate with those responsible for administration of the multisig. They have a responsibility to answer these questions for the community. And if they have answered them already, they have a responsibility to share this information in a way that is transparent (back to the poor comms issue). 

There is a consistent flow of funds leaving the Treasury - where are these going? Is it in line with the proposed budget? Decentralised is only any good if those in positions of responsibility are transparent. It's not that I believe they aren't being transparent, it's just there is so much going on that nothing is organised. 

Also, I believe that rewards/dividends are paid out of the Governance contract, not the Treasury. That can be found here: https://etherscan.io/address/0xBa37B002AbaFDd8E89a1995dA52740bbC013D992

As you can see there is a significant yCRV balance.",,,thanks summary liviorazlo think perhaps one first steps perhaps im behind figure communicate responsible administration multisig responsibility answer questions community answered already responsibility share information way transparent back poor comms issue consistent flow funds leaving treasury going line proposed budget decentralised good positions responsibility transparent believe arent transparent much going nothing organised also believe rewardsdividends paid governance contract treasury found see significant ycrv balance

@LivioRazlo :yikes:  i didn't even read everything you typed, but you are overthinking it!!
treasury is below 500k, but that number was a guideline - there is no mechanism to actually keep it exactly to 500k and stream fees to it automatically for refill. it is also unable to deal with assets other than yCRV coming in, so there are different things accumulating. Banteg is building treasury v2, which will be able to convert things into yUSD, stream rewards to vaults strategy creators (i think), maintain the 500k (btw, this is a temporary solution for 6 months only, we will revisit the number before then).

Here are a few options based on feedback. They are mockups â?a little too lo-res and would need cleanup, etc. 

They are all darker than the first pass. I tweaked the radius of the âsmileâ?to make it less Amazon, and more in line with yUSD. 

I think I like 1a and 2a best. Itâs a cleaner read. They are the same design and could both be used as needed.

That said, the rotation with the sideways smile is fun and could be more memorable. The only worry I have there is we risk limiting future design as we are tying ourselves to the smile design element, and a particular direction or placement of the element. But if others love it, Iâm in!

what if you had a distribution mechanism in place
that randomized the method for a certain amount of time at the beginning of the project (eg, a month)?
for instance, there's a theory that a line goes fastest if the last person is served first as opposed to first in, first out
if you made it so being earliest to the distribution was either the best or worst time to join--and no one knew ahead of time which it would be-- it might prevent the ""crowding"" by in-the-know people at the genesis of a project
governance could decide on the boundaries for randomization for what would be acceptable in the most extreme circumstances (party <x> controlling as much as <y%> or as little as <z%> of the supply)

it would be in the best interest of someone who wants to increase the value of their investment to focus on the project solely, because they can't maximize their advantage through timing alone.. which would mean encouraging others to be early adopters

you could also put some randomize function to account for the number of participants. like, as the number of participants grows, the initial distribution either shrinks or grows. so anyone acting out of self-interest would be interested in a ""fair"" distribution that keeps them from being too much or too little of the initial shareholder group

they also don't want to make the distribution so skewed that people don't want to participate, so mutual value creation is the most self-serving outcome",,,posted general think better fit switching distribution mechanism place randomized method certain amount time beginning project eg month instance theres theory line goes fastest last person served first opposed first first made earliest distribution either best worst time joinand one knew ahead time would might prevent crowding intheknow people genesis project governance could decide boundaries randomization would acceptable extreme circumstances party x controlling much little z supply would best interest someone wants increase value investment focus project solely cant maximize advantage timing alone would mean encouraging others early adopters could also put randomize function account number participants like number participants grows initial distribution either shrinks grows anyone acting selfinterest would interested fair distribution keeps much little initial shareholder group also dont want make distribution skewed people dont want participate mutual value creation selfserving outcome

That means you need at least $86k of farm incentives each week to breakeven.  Right now they are issuing 19kish per week (and declining) and if you are 10% of TVL you are getting 19k * 70% (to LP pools) * 10% * $225 FARM price or 300k per week if you dump.  People are just going to keep dumping the token and breakeven will be around $65.   Below that its a death spiral.  Its sort of like a hot-potato (but no one has an incentive to hold).

7.53287e+17,mdesim01,2020/11/10 ä¸å10:47,2020/11/10,"@banteg I agree with you that this proposed system for allocating Yearn Treasury funds to Departments based on stake is at risk of turning into a popularity contest between Departments; however, Iâd argue that the current systemâthat is, the MultiSig having full power over $500,000 Treasury reserveâis also a popularity contest, in the sense that, whoever is closest with the MultiSig signers is at a clear advantage. Furthermore, because the MultiSig signers have, thus far, remained the same since theyâve been empowered (with exception to the few that were swapped out in late August) and the majority of its 9 signers appear to be largely inactive within the Yearn community, Iâm concerned that there is a lack of incentive alignment within the existing MultiSig. Of the 9 active MultiSig signers, on the surface, it appears that only 2 to 4 of them (certainly you and Klim, and maybe Substreight and devops199fan) are active and âup-to-speedâ?enough to make very well-informed decisions about capital allocation. With that said, if this proposal is not the answer (which, once again, I can absolutely see its downsides), Iâd, at the very least, suggest that we find a way to improve activity/engagement of our MultiSig signers until a more solid Treasury Governance plan can be developed. For instance, maybe we can set up a regularly scheduled (weekly? monthly?) vote to re-elect MultiSig signers and swap out those who are inactive in the community, in order to maintain a greater level of checks and balances with regards to capital deployment.",,,banteg agree proposed system allocating yearn treasury funds departments based stake risk turning popularity contest departments however id argue current systemthat multisig full power treasury reserveis also popularity contest sense whoever closest multisig signers clear advantage furthermore multisig signers thus far remained since theyve empowered exception swapped late august majority signers appear largely inactive within yearn community im concerned lack incentive alignment within existing multisig active multisig signers surface appears certainly klim maybe substreight devopsfan active uptospeedenough make wellinformed decisions capital allocation said proposal answer absolutely see downsides id least suggest find way improve activityengagement multisig signers solid treasury governance plan developed instance maybe set regularly scheduled weekly monthly vote reelect multisig signers swap inactive community order maintain greater level checks balances regards capital deployment

Unless interactions with other contributors is in private or invite-only groups, it appears to me that several of the current signers are not actively engaged in Yearn.

The devs do the bulk (if not all) of the work, but unfortunately have very little governance power.  It would be like every country in the world agreeing to be governed by a vote but the US and China each get 1 vote and Suriname gets 10,000 votes.  It really doesn't matter what your proposals are because the appropriate stakeholders don't have a say in what you want to establish.  I feel like every time there is a vote the dev's are holding their breath and saying to themselves 'guys don't f*ck this up.' because they have very little say in the outcome.  Before we establish any formal governance procedures we should correct this disconnect otherwise its just dictating terms to those who don't have a voice yet hold enormous power in the system.  We should probably be required to delegate 25-40% of a token's voting power to a dev controlled multi-sig or mint some YFI tokens (before burning the keys) with a vesting schedule and give to a dev controlled multi-sig.  Only at that point can we have a real conversation about long term governance.  Until then its just YFI holders recognizing this power imbalance and implicitly giving  dev led proposals greater weight of passing (ie: if I have 100 YFI tokens, 25-40 should be an automatic yes vote on things the devs want an I have discretion on the other 60-75).",,,hueylongprez bottom line governance supposed reflective relative power stakeholders system massive disconnect based token initially distributed devs bulk work unfortunately little governance power would like every country world agreeing governed vote us china get vote suriname gets votes really doesnt matter proposals appropriate stakeholders dont say want establish feel like every time vote devs holding breath saying guys dont fck little say outcome establish formal governance procedures correct disconnect otherwise dictating terms dont voice yet hold enormous power system probably required delegate tokens voting power dev controlled multisig mint yfi tokens burning keys vesting schedule give dev controlled multisig point real conversation long term governance yfi holders recognizing power imbalance implicitly giving dev led proposals greater weight passing ie yfi tokens automatic yes vote things devs want discretion

Can we finally put the whole ""YFI is a valueless gov token"" BS CYA party line to bed now? Never did have much credibility, but now that there is a huge push to mint said valueless token and stash ~$100M into the treasury...hopefully no one keeps trying to continue the ""valueless"" charade any longer, just to avoid potential sanctioning...actions speak much louder and claiming ""valueless"" while profiting won't shield anyone. 
Further...this whole ""devs provide value vs holders don't"" argument and mint vs no mint debate has been fascinating to observe.  Suppose we'd need to define value. The idea that those holding a token as nothing more than a show of project support, investment or seeking passive income are of no value couldn't be more misguided. Anyone who understands enterprise and business knows that value takes many forms...and social capital is just as important as fiscal capital to the survival of any startup. And I don't just mean # of followers and sm groups. In traditional markets (yes, we can learn a lot from the last 100 years of traditional finance)...passive shareholders are considered incredibly valuable...most of which simply hold shares (ownership interest) for dividends, income and appreciation. But why? Because they are the bedrock of support for the entire enterprise...they vote, they advocate, they maintain price support, they use and buy product, and provide countless other forms of intangible value. Don't think there is much of an argument that only executives, builders and employees provide value in traditional organizations.

Donating is great, but what if we had a smart contract that took a % of the yields we generated from our vaults in addition to any fiat from our regular jobs and allocated it to another vault - where the principal was in custody of the charity but the yield on that principal was what was sent to the charityâs wallet, as they needed it.

We are steadily deploying our sophisticated 4-Layer modular tech stack, with a sophisticated dual-chain down on L1 where all the security will happen. 
Weâre an OG chain, since â?4, steadily building out our initial L1 Bitcoin fork and completed that roadmap this time last year.
The other side to this running parallel and in lockstep is our NEVM, practically Ethereumâs EVM with a couple of tweaks. Both of these are merge-mined with Bitcoin, currently we use around 20-22% of BTC entire hashrate and we use chainlocks deployed on our masternode layer (~2400 w/ ~$220m tvl) so we can fully inherit that security. 

We are preparing for zkrollups/zkEVM and expect to have these deployed in the next couple of months. 

On our l1 though, we are just about to roll out our ecosystem with some deployments of our Dex and some other primitives including a household name.

What do people think about a partially anonymous forum? Has anyone censored their controversial ideas due to fear of social reprisals? What have you done if your idea goes against the big players in the DAO? Can partial anonymity be a way to start addressing group think?

I understand that social reputation is important in qualifying the ideas but, it also gets in the way of viewing ideas based on its merits. In certain cases, we censor our controversial comments because it goes against the grain of the majority of DAOs and we tend to not point that out because of fear of social reprisal. Again, this may get in the way of having the most effective decision as some ideas are not considered (and that âconsensusâ?is a more of a capitulation than general agreement that we have the best idea.)

I believe that certain topics may require an anon space to assess the ideas by its merits rather than rely too heavily on the social representation (albeit it has an important role in the DAO).

I've put together the following formal request to Activate veYFI and would greatly appreciate anyone's thoughts or feedback. 
While this request is not necessary for veYFI to be Activated (see below), it is prudent we maintain Yearn's ideals to continue to foster effective decentralized collaboration among this awesome, leaderless network. Therefore, if the date and time of Activation has not yet been established, and if all of the contributors have completed their implementation work, then we are to take it upon ourselves, as the voices of Yearn, to set the veYFI Activation date & time. 

**Request to Activate veYFI**
Objective: Formally request to establish a date and time to Activate veYFI.
**Background**: veYFIâs implementation timeline is at the discretion of the contributors doing the implementation work. Contract appears to be completed and ready for Activation. Activation date and time has not yet been made public.
**Acknowledgment**:
Thank you - all who have contributed - for all of your hard work in Yearn and on veYFI and itâs integration(s).

To Those Contributors, we ask,
Can we please publicly set a time and date to Activate veYFI?

The following suggestions were provided:
**Option 1: IMMEDIATELY PLEASE ACTIVATE ASAP AHHH**
â?   Thoughts: Would be ideal to maybe have a public-facing countdown timer and/or a 24hr heads-up so we canâ¦prepare.

**Option 2: Relevant Anniversary Dates:**
veYFIâs YIP 65 was introduced on Dec. 18, 2021, and finalized on Dec. 30, 2021.
â?   Thoughts: Either of those dates may prove viable. Dec. 18 may allow us to catch a greater audience if implemented before the holidays. Post-Dec. 30th could potentially yield lesser attention as the focus is on the holidays, families, and the implementation of New Yearâs goals (less spending, investing, etcâ?. Thereforeâ?if not implemented sooner per Option 1)â?**Formal Request for veYFI Activation:**
